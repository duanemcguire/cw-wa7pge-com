Thank you so much
Where are you going?
Whats going on today?
Sorry about that
Happy Friday
Catch you later
Never mind that
Right on track
Ready to start
Close enough
Sounds about right
Pretty good job
Almost done now
Every day stuff
Maybe next time
Under the table
Above and beyond
First things first
Money cant buy every thing
Worth every penny
Where did you go?
Which way is best?
Could you help me?
Would you like some?
Might be worth it
Should we start now?
Think about it more
Count me in
Looks great to me
Works for me too
Quick lunch break
Large cup of tea
Small world after all
Right place right time
Great minds think alike
Break a leg
Sleep tight buddy
Drive safe
Piece of cake
Knock on wood
Better late than never
Third times a charm
Birds of a feather
Early bird gets worm
Dont count your eggs
Glass half empty
Glass half full
Light at the end
Cut to the chase
Hit the nail on the head
Spill the beans
Let the cat out
Dont cry over spilled milk
When pigs fly
Costs an arm and a leg
Once in a blue moon
Bite the bullet
Jump on the wagon
Cross that bridge later
Rome wasnt built in a day
Better safe than sorry
Dont put all eggs in one basket
Fish out of water
Kill two birds with one stone
Let sleeping dogs lie
Dont judge a book by its cover
Every cloud has silver lining
Good things can wait
Grass is always greener
Haste makes waste
Hope for the best
If at first you fail
Keep your chin up
Look before you leap
Make hay while sun shines
No pain no gain
One step at a time
Practice makes perfect
Slow and steady wins the race
Strike while iron is hot
The early bird gets the worm
Time heals all wounds
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Where theres a will
You cant judge book by its cover
All good things end
Beauty is in the eye
Dont bite the hand
Every dog has its day
Good luck with that
Home is where heart is
Its never too late
Keep your eyes open
Love is in the air
Make the most of it
Out of sight out of mind
Put your money where your mouth is
Take it one day at a time
The best of both worlds
You only live once
