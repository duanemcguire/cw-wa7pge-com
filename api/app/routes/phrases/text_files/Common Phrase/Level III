How are you doing?
Nice to meet you
Long time no see
Whats going on?
See you later
Have a great day
Thank you very much
Youre welcome
Excuse me
Im sorry
No problem
Dont worry about it
What do you think?
I couldnt agree more
Thats a good point
Youve got to be kidding
Better late than never
Break a leg
Its a piece of cake
Dont count your chickens before they hatch
The early bird catches the worm
Actions speak louder than words
A picture is worth a thousand words
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade
Rome wasnt built in a day
Dont put all your eggs in one basket
The grass is always greener on the other side
You cant judge a book by its cover
Kill two birds with one stone
Bite the bullet
Hit the nail on the head
Spill the beans
Let the cat out of the bag
Dont cry over spilled milk
When pigs fly
It costs an arm and a leg
Once in a blue moon
Jump on the bandwagon
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Fish out of water
Let sleeping dogs lie
Every cloud has a silver lining
Good things come to those who wait
Haste makes waste
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst
If at first you dont succeed, try again
Keep your chin up
Look before you leap
Make hay while the sun shines
No pain, no gain
One step at a time
Practice makes perfect
Slow and steady wins the race
Strike while the iron is hot
Time heals all wounds
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Where theres a will, theres a way
All good things must come to an end
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Dont bite the hand that feeds you
Every dog has its day
Home is where the heart is
Its never too late to learn
Love is in the air
Out of sight, out of mind
Put your money where your mouth is
Take it one day at a time
The best of both worlds
You only live once
Alls fair in love and war
Beggars cant be choosers
Curiosity killed the cat
Dont look a gift horse in the mouth
Easy come, easy go
Fortune favors the bold
Great minds think alike
Honesty is the best policy
Ignorance is bliss
Just in the nick of time
Knowledge is power
Laughter is the best medicine
Money doesnt grow on trees
Necessity is the mother of invention
Opposites attract
Patience is a virtue
Quality over quantity
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
Theres no place like home
Variety is the spice of life
What goes around comes around
You cant have your cake and eat it too
A penny saved is a penny earned
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Blood is thicker than water
Dont throw stones in glass houses
Every rose has its thorn
Fool me once, shame on you
Good things happen to good people
If it aint broke, dont fix it
The apple doesnt fall far from the tree
