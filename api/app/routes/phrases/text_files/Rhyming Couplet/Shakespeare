The time is out of joint, O cursed spite  ~  That ever I was born to set it right!
I thank you for this profit, and from hence ~ I’ll love no friend, since love breeds such offence. 
Will you go on, I pray? This is the night  ~ That either makes me, or fordoes me quite.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover, ~ To beautify him only lacks a cover.
Did my heart love till now? Foreswear it, sight. ~ For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night. 
Juliet: Saints do not move, though grant for prayer’s sake. ~ Romeo: Then move not, while my prayer’s effect I take. 
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow ~ That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, ~ So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; ~ And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
My only love sprung from my only hate! ~ Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings ~ That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
Had we but world enough, and time, ~ This coyness, lady, were no crime.
So do thy beauty and thy years full well ~ As cannons to the heavens do repel.
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare ~ As any she belied with false compare.
This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong, ~ To love that well which thou must leave ere long.
Under the greenwood tree, ~ Who loves to lie with me,
For never was a story of more woe ~ Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Double, double toil and trouble; ~ Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
All that glitters is not gold; ~ Often have you heard that told.
