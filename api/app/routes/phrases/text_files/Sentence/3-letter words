The cat sat
The dog ran
We all ate
She has two
Tom ran far
You win big
I see you
The day was hot
Run and hop
He got one
All was new
The sun set
Ask him why
Men dig it
She may cry
Sit by me
See the sky
Let us try
He can run
Bob can win
Tim is sad
Eve may go
We get ice
See the map
He did fix it
Can you hop
She was mad
The kid hid
We ran out
Not my job
She got gas
May we sit
Ten men dig
The fox ran
Go to bed
Eat the pie
See the log
The man sat
We win now
You may see
I got one
She has ink
The gig is up
Sit and eat
Old men say it
The bus hit the fox
I was shy
She can sew
Do not cry
Bob had tea
Eve can fly
You are mad
He was shy
Sam ran by
Jim got wet
We hit oil
One man dug
Tom has a box
She can win
Joy was dim
Run for fun
We may nap
He did hop
Get the can
She won one
We see the bay
The cow ate hay
The pig ran in
I had one or two
See the row
He dug it
The rug was old
You may nod
The boy saw me
Ask for aid
He can sip
She may win
We see him
You got it
Can she sew
He was ill
The sun was up
She has one
The jar was red
We saw two
I got hot
She was wet
Run the tap
You may sit
We win now
All was dim
He dug one
She can try
He has ink
The bee sat
An egg got hot
We all ran
See the web
She had tea
Tom was shy
He can fix it
You may jog
The log was red
She was not
I am fit
He was old
The top was new
We dug one
Joy was big
The kid was mad
One boy sat
The bat hit
You may tap
She can hop
We see joy
The rat ran
The car was hot
He may run
Two men sat
All was wet
We win big
The bag was new
She can mix
He was sad
I got one
He can cut
We eat now
The box was red
She may nap
See the ant
The bug sat
The rug was tan
We can dig
He can row
She can sew
The map was old
Two men ran
We all win
You may row
She had one
He was big
The jar was hot
Can you see
I see her
He dug two
The sky was dim
She may eat
We saw one
Not my cup of tea
All was new
The man sat
She can run
We had ice
The pit was big
He was wet
She got a new car
You win big now
The pen was dry
Joy was his sis
The cow ran out
The pig sat in mud
She may win 
He got ill
We see her
You may hop
She was shy
The sun was low
The boy ran in
We dug a big pit
She had ink
He was fat
She can try
We all sat
He has one
The hen sat
We may win
The log was big
She saw him
The kid ran
One boy ate
The fox sat
We had one
Joe was hot
He may nap
She was sad
You can run
We dug one
He has ink
She can mix
The car ran
