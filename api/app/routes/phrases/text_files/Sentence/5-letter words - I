The cat sat on a mat
I love my dog very much
Rain fell on the roof
She ran to the bus stop
We eat cake at noon
His blue car is fast
They play ball in the yard
My cup is full of tea
The sun is hot today
She wore a red hat
He can swim very well
The bird sang a song
I need to go home now
The book is on the desk
We saw a big fish
Her eyes are green
The old man sat down
They went to the park
I like to read books
The door is wide open
She has a new bike
We play on the beach
The moon is full now
He put his coat on
The fire is very warm
I want some ice cream
The tree is tall
She cut the rope
We walk to work daily
The baby is so cute
He drew a nice pic
The wind blows hard
I can hear the bell
She baked a cake
The ship sails away
We found a gold coin
His joke made me laugh
The snow is white
I gave her a gift
The lake is calm
She sang a sad song
We ate lunch at one
The stars shine at night
He owns a red truck
The path leads up
I need new shoes
She took a long nap
We saw the full moon
The grass is green
He lost his keys
The train left on time
I drank cold milk
She wore blue jeans
We camp by the river
The flag waves high
He built a sand fort
The horse runs fast
I pick red roses
She has long hair
We cook food at home
The bear is big
He flies a red kite
The bus is late today
I wrote a short note
She runs five miles
We went to see a show
The wall is very high
He drove his new car
The apple is sweet
I made a wish
She wore a warm coat
We heard a loud noise
The boat floats well
He ate a hot dog
The clock shows two
I need more time
She has a pet cat
We sat by the fire
The bee makes honey
He read the news
The fish swims down
I want to go out
She has soft skin
We love to dance
The corn is ripe now
He plays the drum
The baby can walk
I see a bright star
She made fresh bread
We climb the hill
The owl hoots at night
He has a good job
The milk is cold
I wear warm socks
She rides her bike
We pick wild berries
The duck swims in pond
He has a big smile
The cake smells good
I like your new hat
She plays the piano
We go to bed early
The fox is sly
He digs in the dirt
The soup is hot
I wave at my friend
She has a kind heart
We watch the sunset
The rock is hard
He cuts the wood
The rose smells nice
I eat an orange
She runs very fast
We build a snow man
The cloud is gray
He ties his shoe
The pie tastes good
I feel the warm sun
She plants new seeds
We take a long walk
The frog jumps high
He buys fresh fruit
The room is dark
I turn on the light
She has a blue dress
We swim in the sea
The ant works hard
He sits on a chair
The bread is warm
I love the ocean
She picks yellow flowers
We see a nice view
The egg is fresh
He runs up the hill
The jam is sweet
I play with my toys
She has big eyes
We eat at six
The lamb is white
He wins the race
The tea is hot
I like to sing songs
She has a good voice
We drive to town
The hawk flies high
He paints the wall
The honey is golden
I help my mom
She has a nice smile
We play in the snow
The sun sets in west
He digs a deep hole
The plum is ripe
I wear my warm hat
She feeds the birds
We sail on the lake
The pig rolls in mud
He lifts the heavy box
The mint tastes fresh
I count to ten
She has soft hands
We rest in shade
The hen lays eggs
He jumps over the log
The dew is on grass
I smell the flowers
She has long legs
We eat ice cream
The wolf howls loud
He swims in the pool
The bean grows tall
I ride my bike
She has a pet bird
We cook on the grill
The seal swims deep
He runs to the store
The plum tree blooms
I drink hot soup
She has dark hair
We walk on the sand
The cub plays with mom
He reads a good book
The meat is tender
I wave my hand
She has a warm heart
We sit by the pond
The fly buzzes loud
He kicks the ball
The lemon is sour
I love my family
She has many pets
We pick ripe fruit
The deer runs away
He feeds the fish
The cream is thick
I play in the park
She has new shoes
We camp under stars
The wasp stings hard
He loves to cook food
