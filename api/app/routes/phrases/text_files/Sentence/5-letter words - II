The cat sat on my lap
I see a big red car
He ran to the old bus
We eat pie at two
Her new hat is too big
The sun is hot now
She can run far and fast
My dog has wet mud on him
The boy got a new toy
I may go out for tea
His arm got cut by a can
The owl sat on the box
We won the fun game
She did her job all day
The ice was too cold
I put the cup on top
He has a sore leg now
The egg is in the pan
She hid the key by the bed
We saw the man run off
I may buy the red pen
His eye is big and blue
The fox ran up the log
She got mad at the bad cat
I hit the ball far out
The pig got wet in mud
He let me use his car
We cut the old rope
The bee sat on a red rose
I ate the pie for lunch
She has a pet rat now
The wind blew my hat off
He dug a big hole
I saw the moon up high
The fish can not get out
She ran out of gas
I got a new job last week
The boy hit the ball hard
We had fun at the zoo
His leg is hurt bad
The dog ran to get the toy
I may go to bed now
She put oil in the pan
The hen lay two eggs
He got wet in the rain
I can see the big ship
The cow ate all the hay
She has a cut on her arm
We saw a bat fly by
I got up at six today
The ant ran up my leg
He may come by at two
She put jam on the bread
The rat hid in the box
I hit my toe on the step
The bee got him on his ear
We saw the sun set
His hat blew off his head
The fox got the hen
I cut my lip on the can
She has a new red bag
The boy ran to his mom
We ate cake and ice tea
I may get a new pet
The owl can see at night
He dug up an old bone
She got the job she wants
The pig lay in the mud
I saw a big black bug
The cat got up on the roof
He ran as fast as he can
We had tea and dry cake
The dog bit the bad man
I put the pot on the stove
She may go to the show
The boy got a cut on his toe
We saw two deer run by
I can run far but not fast
The hen sat on her eggs
He put gas in his old car
She ate the pie I made
The fox ran to the den
I got wet in the cold rain
The bee sat on my arm
We had fun on our trip
His dog can do fun tricks
The cat hid by the old shed
I may buy a new hat
She got mud on her new shoe
The owl sat up in the tree
We saw the man dig a hole
I ate all of the cake
The boy ran to get help
He may come see me at ten
The dog ran out in the yard
She put the cup on the table
I can see the bus now
The pig got out of the pen
We had soup and hot tea
His arm got hurt at work
The cat can see in the dark
I may go get some new shoes
She put oil in her car
The hen ran to her nest
We saw the old man sit down
I got a bee sting on my leg
The dog ate all his food
He may come by to see us
She ran to catch the bus
The fox hid in tall grass
I can see the big moon
The boy got mud on his pants
We ate lunch at one
His hat fell in the water
The cat sat by the warm fire
I may get sick if I go out
She put the key in her bag
The owl flew off to hunt
We saw a deer by the road
I hit the ball over the fence
The dog ran to his bed
He may fix his old car
She got paint on her arm
The pig ate all the corn
I can see the red sun set
The boy ran up the big hill
We had pie for our lunch
His leg got hurt when he fell
The cat hid under the bed
I may go out to get milk
She put soap on her hands
The hen ate bugs in the dirt
We saw the man walk his dog
I got wet when it rained
The fox ran away fast
He may come see us at eight
She put the pan on the stove
The owl sat on a tree branch
We had cake and hot coffee
I can run but not very far
The dog got his toy wet
His arm got sore from work
She may buy a new car
The cat ran up the tall tree
I ate soup and bread today
The boy got a cut on his chin
We saw two cats fight
He may go to bed early
The pig lay in cool mud
I can see stars up in the sky
She put jam on her toast
The hen lay eggs in her nest
We had lunch out on the deck
His hat fell off when he ran
The dog ran to catch the cat
I may get a job at the bank
She got oil on her new dress
The owl can fly with no sound
We saw the sun come up
I hit my hand on the door
The cat sat in the warm sun
He may fix the old fence
She put salt on her food
The pig ran out of his pen
We had tea and cookies
I can see the bus come now
The boy got mud on his shirt
His dog ran to get the stick
She may go out for dinner
The fox hid by the old barn
I ate cake at the party
The hen sat on her nest
We saw a bat fly at night
He may come by at nine
The cat got wet in the rain
I put honey on my toast
She ran to catch her hat
The owl sat on the fence post
We had soup for lunch today
His arm got tan in the sun
The dog ran in the yard
I may buy some new pants
She got mud on her shoes
The pig ate corn from the can
We saw the moon rise up
I can run up the steep hill
The boy got a bee sting
He may go fish at the lake
The cat hid from the dog
I ate all the pie myself
She put gas in her truck
The hen ran from the fox
We had fun at the fair
His leg got wet in the creek
The dog ate his dinner fast
I may get up early today
She put the pot in the sink
The owl flew off at dawn
We saw deer run in the woods
I can see the old red barn
