The small cat loves to sleep
I found a shiny penny today
Roses bloom every spring month
She walks her brown puppy daily
We baked fresh bread this morn
His green truck needs new tires
They dance under bright stars
My phone rings three times
The ocean waves crash loudly
She wears a white dress well
He plays piano music softly
The birds chirp every dawn
I need to clean my house
The novel sits on her shelf
We caught five large trout
Her smile lights up rooms
The young child draws weird pics
They moved to a small town
I enjoy drink sweet cider
The heavy door swung open wide
She bought a fancy red purse
We plant seeds in rich soil
The honey bee makes gold wax
He threw his dirty shirt away
The cozy fire warms our souls
I crave spicy food every night
The maple tree grows super tall
She fixes her messy brown hair
We drive along windy roads
The happy baby giggles often
He draws funny faces with chalk
The storm winds howl all night
I can sense rain in air
She makes sweet cake mixes
The cargo ship sails far away
We found old coins in dirt
His silly jokes crack me up
The thick snow melts slowly
I gave her fresh picked roses
The calm lake holds many fish
She sings sweet songs softly
We share lunch under shade
The tiny stars twinkle above
He drives his fancy sports car
The rocky path leads up high
I want new boots for winter
She takes quick power naps
We watch the round full moon
The lush grass feels soft
He lost his brass house keys
The rapid train moves on time
I drank fresh cream from farm
She wears tight blue jeans
We camp beside the clear river
The proud flag waves up high
He built a sandy beach fort
The swift horse runs super fast
I pick sweet red berry fruit
She braids her silky long hair
We cook tasty meals at home
The giant brown bear sleeps
He flies his paper kite high
The late bus comes at three
I wrote a brief thank you note
She jogs about three miles
We went to see a great show
The brick wall stands very tall
He drove his shiny black car
The crisp apple tastes super sweet
I made a lucky penny wish
She wears her thick wool coat
We heard a sharp loud crack
The small boat floats quite well
He ate a juicy hot dog
The round clock shows half past two
I need much more quiet time
She has a fluffy gray cat
We sat close by the warm fire
The busy bee makes thick honey
He reads daily sport news
The gold fish swims round tank
I want to go out right now
She has very smooth pale skin
We love to dance every night
The sweet corn grows ripe now
He plays loud drums with sticks
The tiny baby learns to crawl
I see one very bright star
She bakes warm fresh bread
We climb the steep rocky hill
The wise owl hoots in dark
He found a really good job
The cold milk tastes super fresh
I wear thick warm fuzzy socks
She rides her pink bike fast
We pick wild sweet berry fruit
The white duck swims in pond
He has a big happy grin
The round cake smells great
I really like your new hat
She plays soft piano music
We go to sleep quite early
The sly red fox hides well
He digs holes in rich black dirt
The thick soup steams in bowl
I wave at my close dear friend
She has a very kind heart
We watch the pretty sunset
The hard rock feels rough
He cuts thick wood with saw
The pink rose smells super nice
I eat a juicy sweet orange
She runs at a very fast pace
We build a tall white snow man
The gray cloud drops light rain
He ties his loose brown shoe
The apple pie tastes really good
I feel the nice warm sun rays
She plants tiny green seeds
We take long walks every day
The green frog jumps super high
He buys fresh fruit at store
The empty room feels quite dark
I turn on the bright white light
She has a fancy blue dress
We swim in the clear blue sea
The tiny black ant works hard
He sits on a soft chair
The warm bread smells great
I truly love the deep ocean
She picks bright yellow daisy
We see a great view from here
The fresh egg cooks in pan
He runs up the steep hill
The sweet jam tastes great
I play with my new fun toys
She has large brown eyes
We eat our meals at six
The white lamb sleeps in field
He wins the long hard race
The green tea tastes quite good
I like to sing happy songs
She has a sweet clear voice
We drive our car to town
The brown hawk flies up high
He paints the old brick wall
The thick honey looks golden
I often help my dear mom
She has a warm bright smile
We love to play in white snow
The round sun sets in west
He digs a very deep hole
The ripe plum tastes quite sweet
I wear my thick warm wool hat
She feeds small birds every day
We sail our boat on calm lake
The pink pig rolls in thick mud
He lifts the super heavy box
The fresh mint tastes quite good
I count from one up to ten
She has very soft smooth hands
We rest in cool tree shade
The brown hen lays white eggs
He jumps right over the log
The fresh dew sits on grass
I smell the sweet fresh roses
She has very long thin legs
We eat cold sweet ice cream
The gray wolf howls quite loud
He swims laps in the blue pool
The green bean plant grows tall
I ride my red bike to work
She has a small pet bird
We cook meat on the hot grill
The brown seal swims very deep
He runs fast to the big store
The plum tree blooms every year
I drink warm thick soup slow
She has thick wavy dark hair
We walk along the soft sand
The bear cub plays with mom
He reads one really good book
The fresh meat looks tender
I wave my right hand up high
She has a truly warm heart
We sit close by the small pond
The black fly buzzes super loud
He kicks the round ball hard
The sour lemon makes face pucker
I truly love my whole family
She has quite a few pets
We pick sweet ripe fruit daily
The brown deer runs far away
He feeds tiny fish every day
The thick cream looks quite rich
I love to play in the park
She has some fancy new shoes
We camp under bright night stars
The angry wasp stings quite hard
He truly loves to cook good food
