MY SHIP AND I
O ITS I that am the captain of a tidy little ship,
Of a ship that goes a-sailing on the pond;
And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about;
But when Im a little older, I shall find the secret out
How to send my vessel sailing on beyond.
For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm,
And the dolly I intend to come alive;
And with him beside to help me, its a-sailing I shall go,
Its a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow
And the vessel goes a divie-divie dive.
O its then youll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds,
And youll hear the water singing at the prow;
For beside the dolly sailor, Im to voyage and explore,
To land upon the island where no dolly was before,
And to fire the penny cannon in the bow.
