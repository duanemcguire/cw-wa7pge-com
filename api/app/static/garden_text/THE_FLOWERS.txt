THE FLOWERS
ALL the names I know from nurse:
Gardeners garters, Shepherds purse,
Bachelors buttons, Ladys smock,
And the lady Hollyhock.
Fairy places, fairy things,
Fairy woods where the wild bee wings,
Tiny trees for tiny dames--
These must all be fairy names!
Tiny woods below whose boughs
Shady fairies weave a house;
Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme,
Where the braver fairies climb!
Fair are grown-up peoples trees,
But the fairest woods are these;
Where, if I were not so tall,
I should live for good and all.
