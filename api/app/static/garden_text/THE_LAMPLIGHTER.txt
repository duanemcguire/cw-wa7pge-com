THE LAMPLIGHTER
MY tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky;
Its time to take the window to see Leerie going by;
For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,
With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.
Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,
And my papas a banker and as rich as he can be;
But I, when I am stronger and can choose what Im to do,
O Leerie, Ill go round at night and light the lamps with you!
For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,
And Leery stops to light it as he lights so many more;
And O! before you hurry by with ladder and with light,
O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night!
