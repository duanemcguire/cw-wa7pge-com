THE WIND
I SAW you toss the kites on high
And blow the birds about the sky;
And all around I heard you pass,
Like ladies skirts across the grass--
O wind, a-blowing all day long,
O wind, that sings so loud a song!
I saw the different things you did,
But always you yourself you hid.
I felt you push, I heard you call,
I could not see yourself at all--
O wind, a-blowing all day long,
O wind, that sings so loud a song!
[Illustration: THE WIND
I felt you push, I heard you call,
I could not see yourself at all--]
O you that are so strong and cold,
O blower, are you young or old?
Are you a beast of field and tree,
Or just a stronger child than me?
O wind, a-blowing all day long,
O wind, that sings so loud a song!
