          Princess of Mars ch10 pt11          

Scarcely had his hideous laugh rang out but once, when I was upon
him.  The brute was twelve feet in height and armed to the teeth,
but I believe that I could have accounted for the whole roomful in
the terrific intensity of my rage.  Springing upward, I struck him
full in the face as he turned at my warning cry and then as he drew
his short sword I drew mine and sprang up again upon his breast,
hooking one leg over the butt of his pistol and grasping one of his
huge tusks with my left hand while I delivered blow after blow upon
his enormous chest.

He could not use his short sword to advantage because I was too
close to him, nor could he draw his pistol, which he attempted to do
in direct opposition to Martian custom which says that you may not
fight a fellow warrior in private combat with any other than the
weapon with which you are attacked.  In fact he could do nothing but
make a wild and futile attempt to dislodge me.  With all his immense
bulk he was little if any stronger than I, and it was but the matter
of a moment or two before he sank, bleeding and lifeless, to the
floor.

Dejah Thoris had raised herself upon one elbow and was watching the
battle with wide, staring eyes.          end of pt11
