          Princess of Mars ch10 pt3            His response to my manifestation of affection was
remarkable to a degree, he stretched his great mouth to its full
width, baring the entire expanse of his upper rows of tusks and
wrinkling his snout until his great eyes were almost hidden by the
folds of flesh.  If you have ever seen a collie smile you may have
some idea of Woolas facial distortion.

He threw himself upon his back and fairly wallowed at my feet,
jumped up and sprang upon me, rolling me upon the ground by his
great weight, then wriggling and squirming around me like a playful
puppy presenting its back for the petting it craves.  I could not
resist the ludicrousness of the spectacle, and holding my sides I
rocked back and forth in the first laughter which had passed my lips
in many days, the first, in fact, since the morning Powell had left
camp when his horse, long unused, had precipitately and unexpectedly
bucked him off headforemost into a pot of frijoles.

My laughter frightened Woola, his antics ceased and he crawled
pitifully toward me, poking his ugly head far into my lap, and then
I remembered what laughter signified on Mars torture, suffering,
death.          end of pt3
