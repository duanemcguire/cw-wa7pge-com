There was no further question of authority between us, Woola was my
devoted slave from that moment hence, and I his only and undisputed
master.  My walk to the hills occupied but a few minutes, and I
found nothing of particular interest to reward me.  Numerous
brilliantly colored and strangely formed wild flowers dotted the
ravines and from the summit of the first hill I saw still other
hills stretching off toward the north, and rising, one range above
another, until lost in mountains of quite respectable dimensions,
though I afterward found that only a few peaks on all Mars exceed
four thousand feet in height, the suggestion of magnitude was merely
relative.

resulted in a perfect understanding with Woola, upon whom Tars
Tarkas relied for my safe keeping.  I now knew that while
theoretically a prisoner I was virtually free, and I hastened to
