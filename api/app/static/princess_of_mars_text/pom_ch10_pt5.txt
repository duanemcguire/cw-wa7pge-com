          Princess of Mars ch10 pt5            The adventure decided me never
again to leave the limits of my prescribed stamping grounds until I
was ready to venture forth for good and all, as it would certainly
result in a curtailment of my liberties, as well as the probable
death of Woola, were we to be discovered.

On regaining the plaza I had my third glimpse of the captive girl.
She was standing with her guards before the entrance to the audience
chamber, and as I approached she gave me one haughty glance and
turned her back full upon me.  The act was so womanly, so earthly
womanly, that though it stung my pride it also warmed my heart with
a feeling of companionship, it was good to know that someone else on
Mars beside myself had human instincts of a civilized order, even
though the manifestation of them was so painful and mortifying.

Had a green Martian woman desired to show dislike or contempt she
would, in all likelihood, have done it with a sword thrust or a
movement of her trigger finger, but as their sentiments are mostly
atrophied it would have required a serious injury to have aroused
such passions in them.  Sola, let me add, was an exception, I never
saw her perform a cruel or uncouth act, or fail in uniform
kindliness and good nature.          end of pt5
