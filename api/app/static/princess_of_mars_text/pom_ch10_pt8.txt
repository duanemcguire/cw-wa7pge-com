And the nature of your expedition? he continued.

It was a purely scientific research party sent out by my fathers
father, the Jeddak of Helium, to rechart the air currents, and to
take atmospheric density tests, replied the fair prisoner, in a
low, well modulated voice.

We were unprepared for battle, she continued, as we were on a
peaceful mission, as our banners and the colors of our craft
denoted.  The work we were doing was as much in your interests as
in ours, for you know full well that were it not for our labors and
the fruits of our scientific operations there would not be enough
air or water on Mars to support a single human life.  For ages we
have maintained the air and water supply at practically the same
point without an appreciable loss, and we have done this in the
face of the brutal and ignorant interference of your green men.

Why, oh, why will you not learn to live in amity with your fellows,
must you ever go on down the ages to your final extinction but
little above the plane of the dumb brutes that serve you.  A people
without written language, without art, without homes, without love,
the victim of eons of the horrible community idea.          end of pt8
