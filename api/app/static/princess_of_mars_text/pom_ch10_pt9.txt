          Princess of Mars ch10 pt9            Owning
everything in common, even to your women and children, has resulted
in your owning nothing in common.  You hate each other as you hate
all else except yourselves.  Come back to the ways of our common
ancestors, come back to the light of kindliness and fellowship.  The
way is open to you, you will find the hands of the red men stretched
out to aid you.  Together we may do still more to regenerate our
dying planet.  The granddaughter of the greatest and mightiest of
the red jeddaks has asked you.  Will you come?

speak, a look almost of benignity, of kindliness, momentarily
lighted up his fierce and terrible countenance.          end of pt9
