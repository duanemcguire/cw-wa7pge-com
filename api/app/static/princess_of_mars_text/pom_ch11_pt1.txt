          Princess of Mars ch11 pt1          CHAPTER XI

WITH DEJAH THORIS

As we reached the open the two female guards who had been detailed
to watch over Dejah Thoris hurried up and made as though to assume
custody of her once more.  The poor child shrank against me and I
felt her two little hands fold tightly over my arm.  Waving the
women away, I informed them that Sola would attend the captive
hereafter, and I further warned Sarkoja that any more of her cruel
attentions bestowed upon Dejah Thoris would result in Sarkojas
sudden and painful demise.

My threat was unfortunate and resulted in more harm than good to
Dejah Thoris, for, as I learned later, men do not kill women upon
Mars, nor women, men.  So Sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and
departed to hatch up deviltries against us.

I soon found Sola and explained to her that I wished her to guard
Dejah Thoris as she had guarded me, that I wished her to find other
quarters where they would not be molested by Sarkoja, and I finally
informed her that I myself would take up my quarters among the men.

Sola glanced at the accouterments which were carried in my hand and
slung across my shoulder.

You are a great chieftain now, John Carter, she said, and I
must do your bidding, though indeed I am glad to do it under any
circumstances.          end of pt1
