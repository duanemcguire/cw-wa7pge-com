          Princess of Mars ch11 pt3            These
were of people like myself, and of a much lighter color than
Dejah Thoris.  They were clad in graceful, flowing robes, highly
ornamented with metal and jewels, and their luxuriant hair was of
a beautiful golden and reddish bronze.  The men were beardless
and only a few wore arms.  The scenes depicted for the most part,
a fair skinned, fair haired people at play.

Dejah Thoris clasped her hands with an exclamation of rapture as she
gazed upon these magnificent works of art, wrought by a people long
extinct, while Sola, on the other hand, apparently did not see them.

We decided to use this room, on the second floor and overlooking
the plaza, for Dejah Thoris and Sola, and another room adjoining
and in the rear for the cooking and supplies.  I then dispatched
Sola to bring the bedding and such food and utensils as she might
need, telling her that I would guard Dejah Thoris until her return.

As Sola departed Dejah Thoris turned to me with a faint smile.

And whereto, then, would your prisoner escape should you leave her,
unless it was to follow you and crave your protection, and ask your
pardon for the cruel thoughts she has harbored against you these
past few days?

You are right, I answered, there is no escape for either of us
unless we go together.          end of pt3
