          Princess of Mars ch11 pt5          

I do not know your customs, Dejah Thoris, but in my own Virginia
a gentleman does not lie to save himself, I am not of Dor, I have
never seen the mysterious Iss, the lost sea of Korus is still lost,
so far as I am concerned.  Do you believe me?

And then it struck me suddenly that I was very anxious that she
should believe me.  It was not that I feared the results which would
follow a general belief that I had returned from the Barsoomian
heaven or hell, or whatever it was.  Why was it, then.  Why should
I care what she thought?  I looked down at her, her beautiful face
upturned, and her wonderful eyes opening up the very depth of her
soul, and as my eyes met hers I knew why, and I shuddered.

A similar wave of feeling seemed to stir her, she drew away from me
with a sigh, and with her earnest, beautiful face turned up to mine,
she whispered, I believe you, John Carter, I do not know what a
gentleman is, nor have I ever heard before of Virginia, but on
Barsoom no man lies, if he does not wish to speak the truth he is
silent.  Where is this Virginia, your country, John Carter? she
asked, and it seemed that this fair name of my fair land had never
sounded more beautiful than as it fell from those perfect lips on
that far gone day.          end of pt5
