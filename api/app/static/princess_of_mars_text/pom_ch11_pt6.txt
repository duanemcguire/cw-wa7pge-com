          Princess of Mars ch11 pt6          

I am of another world, I answered, the great planet Earth, which
revolves about our common sun and next within the orbit of your
Barsoom, which we know as Mars.  How I came here I cannot tell you,
for I do not know, but here I am, and since my presence has
permitted me to serve Dejah Thoris I am glad that I am here.

She gazed at me with troubled eyes, long and questioningly.  That
it was difficult to believe my statement I well knew, nor could I
hope that she would do so however much I craved her confidence and
respect.  I would much rather not have told her anything of my
antecedents, but no man could look into the depth of those eyes
and refuse her slightest behest.

Finally she smiled, and, rising, said, I shall have to believe even
though I cannot understand.  I can readily perceive that you are not
of the Barsoom of today, you are like us, yet different but why
should I trouble my poor head with such a problem, when my heart
tells me that I believe because I wish to believe.

It was good logic, good, earthly, feminine logic, and if it
satisfied her I certainly could pick no flaws in it.  As a matter of
fact it was about the only kind of logic that could be brought to
bear upon my problem.          end of pt6
