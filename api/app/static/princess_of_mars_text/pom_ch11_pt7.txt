          Princess of Mars ch11 pt7            We fell into a general conversation then,
asking and answering many questions on each side.  She was curious
to learn of the customs of my people and displayed a remarkable
knowledge of events on Earth.  When I questioned her closely on this
seeming familiarity with earthly things she laughed, and cried out,

Why, every school boy on Barsoom knows the geography, and much
concerning the fauna and flora, as well as the history of your
planet fully as well as of his own.  Can we not see everything which
takes place upon Earth, as you call it, is it not hanging there in
the heavens in plain sight?

This baffled me, I must confess, fully as much as my statements had
confounded her, and I told her so.  She then explained in general
the instruments her people had used and been perfecting for ages,
which permit them to throw upon a screen a perfect image of what
is transpiring upon any planet and upon many of the stars.  These
pictures are so perfect in detail that, when photographed and
enlarged, objects no greater than a blade of grass may be distinctly
recognized.  I afterward, in Helium, saw many of these pictures, as
well as the instruments which produced them.          end of pt7
