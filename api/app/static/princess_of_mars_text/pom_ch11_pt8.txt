          Princess of Mars ch11 pt8          

If, then, you are so familiar with earthly things, I asked, why
is it that you do not recognize me as identical with the inhabitants
of that planet?

She smiled again as one might in bored indulgence of a questioning
child.

Because, John Carter, she replied, nearly every planet and star
having atmospheric conditions at all approaching those of Barsoom,
shows forms of animal life almost identical with you and me, and,
further, Earth men, almost without exception, cover their bodies
with strange, unsightly pieces of cloth, and their heads with
hideous contraptions the purpose of which we have been unable to
conceive, while you, when found by the Tharkian warriors, were
entirely undisfigured and unadorned.

The fact that you wore no ornaments is a strong proof of your
un Barsoomian origin, while the absence of grotesque coverings
might cause a doubt as to your earthliness.

I then narrated the details of my departure from the Earth,
explaining that my body there lay fully clothed in all the, to her,
strange garments of mundane dwellers.  At this point Sola returned
with our meager belongings and her young Martian protege, who, of
course, would have to share the quarters with them.          end of pt8
