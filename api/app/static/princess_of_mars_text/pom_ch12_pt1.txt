          Princess of Mars ch12 pt1          CHAPTER XII

A PRISONER WITH POWER

As I entered and saluted, Lorquas Ptomel signaled me to advance,
and, fixing his great, hideous eyes upon me, addressed me thus,

You have been with us a few days, yet during that time you have
by your prowess won a high position among us.  Be that as it may,
you are not one of us, you owe us no allegiance.

Your position is a peculiar one, he continued, you are a prisoner
and yet you give commands which must be obeyed, you are an alien and
yet you are a Tharkian chieftain, you are a midget and yet you can
kill a mighty warrior with one blow of your fist.  And now you are
reported to have been plotting to escape with another prisoner of
another race, a prisoner who, from her own admission, half believes
you are returned from the valley of Dor.  Either one of these
accusations, if proved, would be sufficient grounds for your
execution, but we are a just people and you shall have a trial on
our return to Thark, if Tal Hajus so commands.

But, he continued, in his fierce guttural tones, if you run off
with the red girl it is I who shall have to account to Tal Hajus,
it is I who shall have to face Tars Tarkas, and either demonstrate
my right to command, or the metal from my dead carcass will go to
a better man, for such is the custom of the Tharks.

I have no quarrel with Tars Tarkas, together we rule supreme the
greatest of the lesser communities among the green men, we do not
wish to fight between ourselves, and so if you were dead, John
Carter, I should be glad.          end of pt1
