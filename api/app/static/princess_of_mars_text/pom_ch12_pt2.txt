          Princess of Mars ch12 pt2            Under two conditions only, however, may
you be killed by us without orders from Tal Hajus, in personal
combat in self defense, should you attack one of us, or were you
apprehended in an attempt to escape.

As a matter of justice I must warn you that we only await one
of these two excuses for ridding ourselves of so great a
responsibility.  The safe delivery of the red girl to Tal Hajus
is of the greatest importance.  Not in a thousand years have the
Tharks made such a capture, she is the granddaughter of the
greatest of the red jeddaks, who is also our bitterest enemy.
I have spoken.  The red girl told us that we were without the
softer sentiments of humanity, but we are a just and truthful
race.  You may go.

Turning, I left the audience chamber.  So this was the beginning of
Sarkojas persecution.  I knew that none other could be responsible
for this report which had reached the ears of Lorquas Ptomel so
quickly, and now I recalled those portions of our conversation
which had touched upon escape and upon my origin.

Sarkoja was at this time Tars Tarkas oldest and most trusted
female.  As such she was a mighty power behind the throne, for no
warrior had the confidence of Lorquas Ptomel to such an extent as
did his ablest lieutenant, Tars Tarkas.

However, instead of putting thoughts of possible escape from my
mind, my audience with Lorquas Ptomel only served to center my
every faculty on this subject.          end of pt2
