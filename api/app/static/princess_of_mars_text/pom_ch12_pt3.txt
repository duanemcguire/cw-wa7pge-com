          Princess of Mars ch12 pt3            Now, more than before, the absolute
necessity for escape, in so far as Dejah Thoris was concerned, was
impressed upon me, for I was convinced that some horrible fate
awaited her at the headquarters of Tal Hajus.

As described by Sola, this monster was the exaggerated
personification of all the ages of cruelty, ferocity, and brutality
from which he had descended.  Cold, cunning, calculating, he was,
also, in marked contrast to most of his fellows, a slave to that
brute passion which the waning demands for procreation upon their
dying planet has almost stilled in the Martian breast.

The thought that the divine Dejah Thoris might fall into the
clutches of such an abysmal atavism started the cold sweat upon me.
Far better that we save friendly bullets for ourselves at the last
moment, as did those brave frontier women of my lost land, who took
their own lives rather than fall into the hands of the Indian
braves.

As I wandered about the plaza lost in my gloomy forebodings Tars
Tarkas approached me on his way from the audience chamber.  His
demeanor toward me was unchanged, and he greeted me as though we
had not just parted a few moments before.

Where are your quarters, John Carter? he asked.

I have selected none, I replied.  It seemed best that I quartered
either by myself or among the other warriors, and I was awaiting an
opportunity to ask your advice.          end of pt3
