          Princess of Mars ch12 pt4            As you know, and I smiled, I am
not yet familiar with all the customs of the Tharks.

Come with me, he directed, and together we moved off across the
plaza to a building which I was glad to see adjoined that occupied
by Sola and her charges.

My quarters are on the first floor of this building, he said, and
the second floor also is fully occupied by warriors, but the third
floor and the floors above are vacant, you may take your choice of
these.

I understand, he continued, that you have given up your woman to
the red prisoner.  Well, as you have said, your ways are not our
ways, but you can fight well enough to do about as you please, and
so, if you wish to give your woman to a captive, it is your own
affair, but as a chieftain you should have those to serve you, and
in accordance with our customs you may select any or all the females
from the retinues of the chieftains whose metal you now wear.

I thanked him, but assured him that I could get along very nicely
without assistance except in the matter of preparing food, and so he
promised to send women to me for this purpose and also for the care
of my arms and the manufacture of my ammunition, which he said would
be necessary.  I suggested that they might also bring some of the
sleeping silks and furs which belonged to me as spoils of combat,
for the nights were cold and I had none of my own.          end of pt4
