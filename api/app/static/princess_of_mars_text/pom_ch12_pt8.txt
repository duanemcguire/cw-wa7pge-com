          Princess of Mars ch12 pt8          

It is true that the green Martians are absolutely virtuous, both
men and women, with the exception of such degenerates as Tal Hajus,
but better far a finer balance of human characteristics even at
the expense of a slight and occasional loss of chastity.

Finding that I must assume responsibility for these creatures,
whether I would or not, I made the best of it and directed them to
find quarters on the upper floors, leaving the third floor to me.
One of the girls I charged with the duties of my simple cuisine,
and directed the others to take up the various activities which had
formerly constituted their vocations.  Thereafter I saw little of
them, nor did I care to.
