          Princess of Mars ch13 pt6          
The moment the sunlight, even though diffused, strikes this powder
it explodes with a violence which nothing can withstand.  If you
ever witness a night battle you will note the absence of these
explosions, while the morning following the battle will be filled at
sunrise with the sharp detonations of exploding missiles fired the
preceding night.  As a rule, however, non exploding projectiles are
used at night.  [I have used the word radium in describing this
powder because in the light of recent discoveries on Earth I believe
it to be a mixture of which radium is the base.  In Captain Carters
manuscript it is mentioned always by the name used in the written
language of Helium and is spelled in hieroglyphics which it would be
difficult and useless to reproduce.]

While I was much interested in Dejah Thoris explanation of this
wonderful adjunct to Martian warfare, I was more concerned by the
immediate problem of their treatment of her.  That they were keeping
her away from me was not a matter for surprise, but that they should
subject her to dangerous and arduous labor filled me with rage.

Have they ever subjected you to cruelty and ignominy, Dejah
Thoris? I asked, feeling the hot blood of my fighting ancestors
leap in my veins as I awaited her reply.

Only in little ways, John Carter, she answered.  Nothing that can
harm me outside my pride.          end of pt6
