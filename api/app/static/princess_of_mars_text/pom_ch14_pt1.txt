          Princess of Mars ch14 pt1          CHAPTER XIV

A DUEL TO THE DEATH

My first impulse was to tell her of my love, and then I thought of
the helplessness of her position wherein I alone could lighten the
burdens of her captivity, and protect her in my poor way against the
thousands of hereditary enemies she must face upon our arrival at
Thark.  I could not chance causing her additional pain or sorrow
by declaring a love which, in all probability she did not return.
Should I be so indiscreet, her position would be even more
unbearable than now, and the thought that she might feel that
I was taking advantage of her helplessness, to influence her
decision was the final argument which sealed my lips.

Why are you so quiet, Dejah Thoris? I asked.  Possibly you
would rather return to Sola and your quarters.

No, she murmured, I am happy here.  I do not know why it is that
I should always be happy and contented when you, John Carter, a
stranger, are with me, yet at such times it seems that I am safe and
that, with you, I shall soon return to my fathers court and feel
his strong arms about me and my mothers tears and kisses on my
cheek.

Do people kiss, then, upon Barsoom? I asked, when she had
explained the word she used, in answer to my inquiry as to its
meaning.

Parents, brothers, and sisters, yes, and, she added in a low,
thoughtful tone, lovers.

And you, Dejah Thoris, have parents and brothers and sisters?

Yes.          end of pt1
