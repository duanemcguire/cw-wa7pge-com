          Princess of Mars ch14 pt10          

I did not need a manual of green Martian etiquette to know what
reply to make, for, in fact, I was so wild with anger that I could
scarcely refrain from drawing my pistol and shooting him down for
the brute he was, but he stood waiting with drawn long sword, and
my only choice was to draw my own and meet him in fair fight with
his choice of weapons or a lesser one.

This latter alternative is always permissible, therefore I could
have used my short sword, my dagger, my hatchet, or my fists had
I wished, and been entirely within my rights, but I could not use
firearms or a spear while he held only his long sword.

I chose the same weapon he had drawn because I knew he prided
himself upon his ability with it, and I wished, if I worsted him
at all, to do it with his own weapon.  The fight that followed was
a long one and delayed the resumption of the march for an hour.
The entire community surrounded us, leaving a clear space about
one hundred feet in diameter for our battle.

Zad first attempted to rush me down as a bull might a wolf, but I
was much too quick for him, and each time I side stepped his rushes
he would go lunging past me, only to receive a nick from my sword
upon his arm or back.  He was soon streaming blood from a half
dozen minor wounds, but I could not obtain an opening to deliver an
effective thrust.  Then he changed his tactics, and fighting warily
and with extreme dexterity, he tried to do by science what he
was unable to do by brute strength.          end of pt10
