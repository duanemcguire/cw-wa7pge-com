          Princess of Mars ch14 pt3          

Yes, I was a fool, but I was in love, and though I was suffering the
greatest misery I had ever known I would not have had it otherwise
for all the riches of Barsoom.  Such is love, and such are lovers
wherever love is known.

To me, Dejah Thoris was all that was perfect, all that was virtuous
and beautiful and noble and good.  I believed that from the bottom
of my heart, from the depth of my soul on that night in Korad as I
sat cross legged upon my silks while the nearer moon of Barsoom
raced through the western sky toward the horizon, and lighted up the
gold and marble, and jeweled mosaics of my world old chamber, and I
believe it today as I sit at my desk in the little study overlooking
the Hudson.  Twenty years have intervened, for ten of them I lived
and fought for Dejah Thoris and her people, and for ten I have lived
upon her memory.

The morning of our departure for Thark dawned clear and hot, as do
all Martian mornings except for the six weeks when the snow melts at
the poles.

I sought out Dejah Thoris in the throng of departing chariots, but
she turned her shoulder to me, and I could see the red blood mount
to her cheek.  With the foolish inconsistency of love I held my
peace when I might have plead ignorance of the nature of my offense,
or at least the gravity of it, and so have effected, at worst, a
half conciliation.          end of pt3
