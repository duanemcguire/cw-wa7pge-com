          Princess of Mars ch14 pt4          

My duty dictated that I must see that she was comfortable, and
so I glanced into her chariot and rearranged her silks and furs.
In doing so I noted with horror that she was heavily chained by
one ankle to the side of the vehicle.

What does this mean? I cried, turning to Sola.

Sarkoja thought it best, she answered, her face betokening her
disapproval of the procedure.

Examining the manacles I saw that they fastened with a massive
spring lock.

Where is the key, Sola?  Let me have it.

Sarkoja wears it, John Carter, she answered.

I turned without further word and sought out Tars Tarkas, to whom I
vehemently objected to the unnecessary humiliations and cruelties,
as they seemed to my lovers eyes, that were being heaped upon Dejah
Thoris.

John Carter, he answered, if ever you and Dejah Thoris escape the
Tharks it will be upon this journey.  We know that you will not go
without her.  You have shown yourself a mighty fighter, and we do
not wish to manacle you, so we hold you both in the easiest way
that will yet ensure security.  I have spoken.

I saw the strength of his reasoning at a flash, and knew that it
were futile to appeal from his decision, but I asked that the
key be taken from Sarkoja and that she be directed to leave the
prisoner alone in future.

This much, Tars Tarkas, you may do for me in return for the
friendship that, I must confess, I feel for you.          end of pt4
