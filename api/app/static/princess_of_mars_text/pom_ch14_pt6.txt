          Princess of Mars ch14 pt6            It was this custom which entitled me
to the names of either of the chieftains I had killed, in fact, some
of the warriors addressed me as Dotar Sojat, a combination of the
surnames of the two warrior chieftains whose metal I had taken, or,
in other words, whom I had slain in fair fight.

As Sarkoja talked with Zad he cast occasional glances in my
direction, while she seemed to be urging him very strongly to some
action.  I paid little attention to it at the time, but the next
day I had good reason to recall the circumstances, and at the same
time gain a slight insight into the depths of Sarkojas hatred and
the lengths to which she was capable of going to wreak her horrid
vengeance on me.

Dejah Thoris would have none of me again on this evening, and though
I spoke her name she neither replied, nor conceded by so much as
the flutter of an eyelid that she realized my existence.  In my
extremity I did what most other lovers would have done, I sought
word from her through an intimate.  In this instance it was Sola
whom I intercepted in another part of camp.

What is the matter with Dejah Thoris? I blurted out at her.
Why will she not speak to me?

Sola seemed puzzled herself, as though such strange actions on
the part of two humans were quite beyond her, as indeed they were,
poor child.

She says you have angered her, and that is all she will say, except
that she is the daughter of a jed and the granddaughter of a jeddak
and she has been humiliated by a creature who could not polish the
teeth of her grandmothers sorak.          end of pt6
