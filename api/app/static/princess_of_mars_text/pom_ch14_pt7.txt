          Princess of Mars ch14 pt7          

I pondered over this report for some time, finally asking,
What might a sorak be, Sola?

A little animal about as big as my hand, which the red
Martian women keep to play with, explained Sola.

Not fit to polish the teeth of her grandmothers cat.  I must rank
pretty low in the consideration of Dejah Thoris, I thought, but I
could not help laughing at the strange figure of speech, so homely
and in this respect so earthly.  It made me homesick, for it sounded
very much like not fit to polish her shoes.  And then commenced a
train of thought quite new to me.  I began to wonder what my people
at home were doing.  I had not seen them for years.  There was a
family of Carters in Virginia who claimed close relationship with
me, I was supposed to be a great uncle, or something of the kind
equally foolish.  I could pass anywhere for twenty five to thirty
years of age, and to be a great uncle always seemed the height of
incongruity, for my thoughts and feelings were those of a boy.
There was two little kiddies in the Carter family whom I had loved
and who had thought there was no one on Earth like Uncle Jack, I
could see them just as plainly, as I stood there under the moonlit
skies of Barsoom, and I longed for them as I had never longed for
any mortals before.  By nature a wanderer, I had never known the
true meaning of the word home, but the great hall of the Carters had
always stood for all that the word did mean to me, and now my heart
turned toward it from the cold and unfriendly peoples I had been
thrown amongst.          end of pt7
