          Princess of Mars ch14 pt8            For did not even Dejah Thoris despise me.  I was a
low creature, so low in fact that I was not even fit to polish the
teeth of her grandmothers cat, and then my saving sense of humor
came to my rescue, and laughing I turned into my silks and furs and
slept upon the moon haunted ground the sleep of a tired and healthy
fighting man.

We broke camp the next day at an early hour and marched with only
a single halt until just before dark.  Two incidents broke the
tediousness of the march.  About noon we espied far to our right
what was evidently an incubator, and Lorquas Ptomel directed Tars
Tarkas to investigate it.  The latter took a dozen warriors,
including myself, and we raced across the velvety carpeting of
moss to the little enclosure.

It was indeed an incubator, but the eggs were very small in
comparison with those I had seen hatching in ours at the time
of my arrival on Mars.

Tars Tarkas dismounted and examined the enclosure minutely, finally
announcing that it belonged to the green men of Warhoon and that
the cement was scarcely dry where it had been walled up.

They cannot be a days march ahead of us, he exclaimed,
the light of battle leaping to his fierce face.

The work at the incubator was short indeed.  The warriors tore open
the entrance and a couple of them, crawling in, soon demolished all
the eggs with their short swords.          end of pt8
