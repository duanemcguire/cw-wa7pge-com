to join the cavalcade.  During the ride I took occasion to ask Tars
Tarkas if these Warhoons whose eggs we had destroyed were a
smaller people than his Tharks.

I noticed that their eggs were so much smaller than those
I saw hatching in your incubator, I added.

He explained that the eggs had just been placed there, but, like all
green Martian eggs, they would grow during the five year period of
incubation until they obtained the size of those I had seen hatching
on the day of my arrival on Barsoom.  This was indeed an interesting
piece of information, for it had always seemed remarkable to me that
the green Martian women, large as they were, could bring forth such
enormous eggs as I had seen the four foot infants emerging from.
As a matter of fact, the new laid egg is but little larger than
an ordinary goose egg, and as it does not commence to grow until
subjected to the light of the sun the chieftains have little
difficulty in transporting several hundreds of them at one time
from the storage vaults to the incubators.

Shortly after the incident of the Warhoon eggs we halted to rest the
animals, and it was during this halt that the second of the days
interesting episodes occurred.  I was engaged in changing my riding
cloths from one of my thoats to the other, for I divided the days

my animal a terrific blow with his long sword.          end of pt9
