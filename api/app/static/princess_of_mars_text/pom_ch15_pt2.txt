          Princess of Mars ch15 pt2          

As soon as they were through with me I hastened to the chariot of
Dejah Thoris, where I found my poor Sola with her chest swathed in
bandages, but apparently little the worse for her encounter with
Sarkoja, whose dagger it seemed had struck the edge of one of Solas
metal breast ornaments and, thus deflected, had inflicted but a
slight flesh wound.

As I approached I found Dejah Thoris lying prone upon her silks
and furs, her lithe form wracked with sobs.  She did not notice my
presence, nor did she hear me speaking with Sola, who was standing
a short distance from the vehicle.

Is she injured? I asked of Sola, indicating Dejah Thoris by an
inclination of my head.

No, she answered, she thinks that you are dead.

And that her grandmothers cat may now have no one to polish its
teeth? I queried, smiling.

I think you wrong her, John Carter, said Sola.  I do not
understand either her ways or yours, but I am sure the granddaughter
of ten thousand jeddaks would never grieve like this over any who
held but the highest claim upon her affections.  They are a proud
race, but they are just, as are all Barsoomians, and you must have
hurt or wronged her grievously that she will not admit your
existence living, though she mourns you dead.

Tears are a strange sight upon Barsoom, she continued, and so it
is difficult for me to interpret them.          end of pt2
