          Princess of Mars ch15 pt3            I have seen but two people
weep in all my life, other than Dejah Thoris, one wept from sorrow,
the other from baffled rage.  The first was my mother, years ago
before they killed her, the other was Sarkoja, when they dragged
her from me today.

Your mother. I exclaimed, but, Sola, you could not have known
your mother, child.

But I did.  And my father also, she added.  If you would like
to hear the strange and un Barsoomian story come to the chariot
tonight, John Carter, and I will tell you that of which I have
never spoken in all my life before.  And now the signal has been
given to resume the march, you must go.

I will come tonight, Sola, I promised.  Be sure to tell Dejah
Thoris I am alive and well.  I shall not force myself upon her,
and be sure that you do not let her know I saw her tears.  If she
would speak with me I but await her command.

Sola mounted the chariot, which was swinging into its place
in line, and I hastened to my waiting thoat and galloped
to my station beside Tars Tarkas at the rear of the column.

We made a most imposing and awe inspiring spectacle as we strung out
across the yellow landscape, the two hundred and fifty ornate and
brightly colored chariots, preceded by an advance guard of some two
hundred mounted warriors and chieftains riding five abreast and one
hundred yards apart, and followed by a like number in the same
formation, with a score or more of flankers on either side, the
fifty extra mastodons, or heavy draught animals, known as zitidars,
and the five or six hundred extra thoats of the warriors running
loose within the hollow square formed by the surrounding warriors.          end of pt3
