          Princess of Mars ch15 pt5          

We camped that night at the foot of the hills we had been
approaching for two days and which marked the southern boundary of
this particular sea.  Our animals had been two days without drink,
nor had they had water for nearly two months, not since shortly
after leaving Thark, but, as Tars Tarkas explained to me, they
require but little and can live almost indefinitely upon the moss
which covers Barsoom, and which, he told me, holds in its tiny stems
sufficient moisture to meet the limited demands of the animals.

After partaking of my evening meal of cheese like food and vegetable
milk I sought out Sola, whom I found working by the light of a torch
upon some of Tars Tarkas trappings.  She looked up at my approach,
her face lighting with pleasure and with welcome.

I am glad you came, she said, Dejah Thoris sleeps and I am
lonely.  Mine own people do not care for me, John Carter, I am too
unlike them.  It is a sad fate, since I must live my life amongst
them, and I often wish that I were a true green Martian woman,
without love and without hope, but I have known love and so I
am lost.

I promised to tell you my story, or rather the story of my parents.
From what I have learned of you and the ways of your people I am
sure that the tale will not seem strange to you, but among green
Martians it has no parallel within the memory of the oldest living
Thark, nor do our legends hold many similar tales.          end of pt5
