He was gone for four years, and when he returned all had been over
for three, for about a year after his departure, and shortly before

expedition from the incubator, to mix me with the other young

impressing upon me the necessity for absolute secrecy and the great
caution I must exercise after she had placed me with the other young
Tharks to permit no one to guess that I was further advanced in
education than they, nor by any sign to divulge in the presence of
others my affection for her, or my knowledge of my parentage, and
