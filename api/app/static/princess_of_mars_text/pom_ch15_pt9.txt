          Princess of Mars ch15 pt9            The torrent of
hatred and abuse she poured out upon her turned my young heart cold
in terror.  That she had heard the entire story was apparent, and
that she had suspected something wrong from my mothers long nightly
absences from her quarters accounted for her presence there on that
fateful night.

One thing she had not heard, nor did she know, the whispered name
of my father.  This was apparent from her repeated demands upon my
mother to disclose the name of her partner in sin, but no amount of
abuse or threats could wring this from her, and to save me from
needless torture she lied, for she told Sarkoja that she alone
knew nor would she even tell her child.

With final imprecations, Sarkoja hastened away to Tal Hajus to
report her discovery, and while she was gone my mother, wrapping me
in the silks and furs of her night coverings, so that I was scarcely
noticeable, descended to the streets and ran wildly away toward the
outskirts of the city, in the direction which led to the far south,
out toward the man whose protection she might not claim, but on
whose face she wished to look once more before she died.

As we neared the citys southern extremity a sound came to us from
across the mossy flat, from the direction of the only pass through
the hills which led to the gates, the pass by which caravans from
either north or south or east or west would enter the city.          end of pt9
