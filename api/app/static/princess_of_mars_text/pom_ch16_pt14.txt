          Princess of Mars ch16 pt14          

I did not rush headlong in, but listened without to assure myself
that it was Dejah Thoris and that it was safe to venture within.  It
was well indeed that I took this precaution, for the conversation I
heard was in the low gutturals of men, and the words which finally
came to me proved a most timely warning.  The speaker was a
chieftain and he was giving orders to four of his warriors.

And when he returns to this chamber, he was saying, as he surely
will when he finds she does not meet him at the citys edge, you
four are to spring upon him and disarm him.  It will require the
combined strength of all of you to do it if the reports they bring
back from Korad are correct.  When you have him fast bound bear him
to the vaults beneath the jeddaks quarters and chain him securely
where he may be found when Tal Hajus wishes him.  Allow him to speak
with none, nor permit any other to enter this apartment before he
comes.  There will be no danger of the girl returning, for by this
time she is safe in the arms of Tal Hajus, and may all her ancestors
have pity upon her, for Tal Hajus will have none, the great Sarkoja
has done a noble nights work.  I go, and if you fail to capture him
when he comes, I commend your carcasses to the cold bosom of Iss.
