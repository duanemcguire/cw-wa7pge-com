          Princess of Mars ch16 pt5          

Without waiting for a further invitation I bolted up the winding
runway which led to the second floor, and entering a great chamber
at the front of the building was greeted by the frenzied Woola, who
threw his great carcass upon me, nearly hurling me to the floor, the
poor old fellow was so glad to see me that I thought he would devour
me, his head split from ear to ear, showing his three rows of tusks
in his hobgoblin smile.

Quieting him with a word of command and a caress, I looked hurriedly
through the approaching gloom for a sign of Dejah Thoris, and then,
not seeing her, I called her name.  There was an answering murmur
from the far corner of the apartment, and with a couple of quick
strides I was standing beside her where she crouched among the furs
and silks upon an ancient carved wooden seat.  As I waited she rose
to her full height and looking me straight in the eye said,

What would Dotar Sojat, Thark, of Dejah Thoris his captive?

Dejah Thoris, I do not know how I have angered you.  It was
furtherest from my desire to hurt or offend you, whom I had hoped
to protect and comfort.  Have none of me if it is your will, but
that you must aid me in effecting your escape, if such a thing be
possible, is not my request, but my command.  When you are safe
once more at your fathers court you may do with me as you please,
but from now on until that day I am your master, and you must obey
and aid me.          end of pt5
