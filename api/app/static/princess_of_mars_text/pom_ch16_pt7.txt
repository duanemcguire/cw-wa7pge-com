          Princess of Mars ch16 pt7          

I will respect your wishes, John Carter, because I understand
the motives which prompt them, and I accept your service no more
willingly than I bow to your authority, your word shall be my
law.  I have twice wronged you in my thoughts and again I ask
your forgiveness.

Further conversation of a personal nature was prevented by the
entrance of Sola, who was much agitated and wholly unlike her
usual calm and possessed self.

That horrible Sarkoja has been before Tal Hajus, she cried, and
from what I heard upon the plaza there is little hope for either of
you.

What do they say? inquired Dejah Thoris.

That you will be thrown to the wild calots [dogs] in the great
arena as soon as the hordes have assembled for the yearly games.

Sola, I said, you are a Thark, but you hate and loathe the
customs of your people as much as we do.  Will you not accompany us
in one supreme effort to escape?  I am sure that Dejah Thoris can
offer you a home and protection among her people, and your fate
can be no worse among them than it must ever be here.

Yes, cried Dejah Thoris, come with us, Sola, you will be better
off among the red men of Helium than you are here, and I can promise
you not only a home with us, but the love and affection your nature
craves and which must always be denied you by the customs of your
own race.  Come with us, Sola, we might go without you, but your
fate would be terrible if they thought you had connived to aid us.          end of pt7
