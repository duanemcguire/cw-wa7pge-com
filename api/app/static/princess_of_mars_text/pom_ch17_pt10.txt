          Princess of Mars ch17 pt10            I knew that
in the ravines and gullies they might find a temporary hiding place,
and even though they died there of hunger and thirst it would be
better so than that they fell into the hands of the Tharks.  Forcing
my two revolvers upon them as a slight means of protection, and, as
a last resort, as an escape for themselves from the horrid death
which recapture would surely mean, I lifted Dejah Thoris in my arms
and placed her upon the thoat behind Sola, who had already mounted
at my command.

Good bye, my princess, I whispered, we may meet in Helium yet.
I have escaped from worse plights than this, and I tried to smile
as I lied.

What, she cried, are you not coming with us?

How may I, Dejah Thoris?  Someone must hold these fellows off for a
while, and I can better escape them alone than could the three of us
together.

She sprang quickly from the thoat and, throwing her dear arms about
my neck, turned to Sola, saying with quiet dignity, Fly, Sola.
Dejah Thoris remains to die with the man she loves.

Those words are engraved upon my heart.  Ah, gladly would I give
up my life a thousand times could I only hear them once again, but
I could not then give even a second to the rapture of her sweet
embrace, and pressing my lips to hers for the first time, I picked
her up bodily and tossed her to her seat behind Sola again,
commanding the latter in peremptory tones to hold her there by
force, and then, slapping the thoat upon the flank, I saw them
borne away, Dejah Thoris struggling to the last to free herself
from Solas grasp.          end of pt10
