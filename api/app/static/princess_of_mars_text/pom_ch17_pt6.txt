          Princess of Mars ch17 pt6            For my part I
could not be other than joyful had I tried, with Dejah Thoris warm
body pressed close to mine, and with all our unpassed danger my
heart was singing as gaily as though we were already entering the
gates of Helium.

Our earlier plans had been so sadly upset that we now found
ourselves without food or drink, and I alone was armed.  We
therefore urged our beasts to a speed that must tell on them
sorely before we could hope to sight the ending of the first
stage of our journey.

We rode all night and all the following day with only a few short
rests.  On the second night both we and our animals were completely
fagged, and so we lay down upon the moss and slept for some five or
six hours, taking up the journey once more before daylight.  All
the following day we rode, and when, late in the afternoon we had
sighted no distant trees, the mark of the great waterways throughout
all Barsoom, the terrible truth flashed upon us we were lost.

Evidently we had circled, but which way it was difficult to say,
nor did it seem possible with the sun to guide us by day and the
moons and stars by night.  At any rate no waterway was in sight,
and the entire party was almost ready to drop from hunger, thirst
and fatigue.  Far ahead of us and a trifle to the right we could
distinguish the outlines of low mountains.  These we decided to
attempt to reach in the hope that from some ridge we might discern
the missing waterway.          end of pt6
