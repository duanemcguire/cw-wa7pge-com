          Princess of Mars ch17 pt9            As what proved to be the last warrior came into view from the
pass, he halted and, to our consternation, threw his small but
powerful fieldglass to his eye and scanned the sea bottom in all
directions.  Evidently he was a chieftain, for in certain marching
formations among the green men a chieftain brings up the extreme
rear of the column.  As his glass swung toward us our hearts stopped
in our breasts, and I could feel the cold sweat start from every
pore in my body.

Presently it swung full upon us and stopped.  The tension on
our nerves was near the breaking point, and I doubt if any of us
breathed for the few moments he held us covered by his glass, and
then he lowered it and we could see him shout a command to the
warriors who had passed from our sight behind the ridge.  He did
not wait for them to join him, however, instead he wheeled his
thoat and came tearing madly in our direction.

There was but one slight chance and that we must take quickly.
Raising my strange Martian rifle to my shoulder I sighted and
touched the button which controlled the trigger, there was a
sharp explosion as the missile reached its goal, and the
charging chieftain pitched backward from his flying mount.

Springing to my feet I urged the thoat to rise, and directed Sola
to take Dejah Thoris with her upon him and make a mighty effort to
reach the hills before the green warriors were upon us.          end of pt9
