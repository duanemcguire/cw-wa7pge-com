          Princess of Mars ch18 pt1          CHAPTER XVIII

CHAINED IN WARHOON

It must have been several hours before I regained consciousness
and I well remember the feeling of surprise which swept over me as
I realized that I was not dead.

I was lying among a pile of sleeping silks and furs in the corner of
a small room in which were several green warriors, and bending over
me was an ancient and ugly female.

As I opened my eyes she turned to one of the warriors, saying,

He will live, O Jed.

Tis well, replied the one so addressed, rising and approaching my
couch, he should render rare sport for the great games.

And now as my eyes fell upon him, I saw that he was no Thark, for
his ornaments and metal were not of that horde.  He was a huge
fellow, terribly scarred about the face and chest, and with one
broken tusk and a missing ear.  Strapped on either breast were human
skulls and depending from these a number of dried human hands.

His reference to the great games of which I had heard so much while
among the Tharks convinced me that I had but jumped from purgatory
into gehenna.

After a few more words with the female, during which she assured him
that I was now fully fit to travel, the jed ordered that we mount
and ride after the main column.

I was strapped securely to as wild and unmanageable a thoat as I had
ever seen, and, with a mounted warrior on either side to prevent the
beast from bolting, we rode forth at a furious pace in pursuit of
the column.  My wounds gave me but little pain, so wonderfully and
rapidly had the applications and injections of the female exercised
their therapeutic powers, and so deftly had she bound and plastered
the injuries.          end of pt1
