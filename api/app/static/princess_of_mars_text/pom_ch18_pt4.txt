          Princess of Mars ch18 pt4          

My introduction to these cruel and bloodthirsty people was but an
index to the scenes I witnessed almost daily while with them.  They
are a smaller horde than the Tharks but much more ferocious.  Not a
day passed but that some members of the various Warhoon communities
met in deadly combat.  I have seen as high as eight mortal duels
within a single day.

We reached the city of Warhoon after some three days march and I was
immediately cast into a dungeon and heavily chained to the floor
and walls.  Food was brought me at intervals but owing to the utter
darkness of the place I do not know whether I lay there days, or
weeks, or months.  It was the most horrible experience of all my
life and that my mind did not give way to the terrors of that inky
blackness has been a wonder to me ever since.  The place was filled
with creeping, crawling things, cold, sinuous bodies passed over me
when I lay down, and in the darkness I occasionally caught glimpses
of gleaming, fiery eyes, fixed in horrible intentness upon me.  No
sound reached me from the world above and no word would my jailer
vouchsafe when my food was brought to me, although I at first
bombarded him with questions.

Finally all the hatred and maniacal loathing for these awful
creatures who had placed me in this horrible place was centered
by my tottering reason upon this single emissary who represented
to me the entire horde of Warhoons.

I had noticed that he always advanced with his dim torch to where he
could place the food within my reach and as he stooped to place it
upon the floor his head was about on a level with my breast.          end of pt4
