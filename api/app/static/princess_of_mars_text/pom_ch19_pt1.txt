          Princess of Mars ch19 pt1          CHAPTER XIX

BATTLING IN THE ARENA

Slowly I regained my composure and finally essayed again to attempt
to remove the keys from the dead body of my former jailer.  But as
I reached out into the darkness to locate it I found to my horror
that it was gone.  Then the truth flashed on me, the owners of
those gleaming eyes had dragged my prize away from me to be
devoured in their neighboring lair, as they had been waiting for
days, for weeks, for months, through all this awful eternity of
my imprisonment to drag my dead carcass to their feast.

For two days no food was brought me, but then a new messenger
appeared and my incarceration went on as before, but not again did
I allow my reason to be submerged by the horror of my position.

Shortly after this episode another prisoner was brought in and
chained near me.  By the dim torch light I saw that he was a red
Martian and I could scarcely await the departure of his guards to
address him.  As their retreating footsteps died away in the
distance, I called out softly the Martian word of greeting, kaor.

Who are you who speaks out of the darkness? he answered

John Carter, a friend of the red men of Helium.

I am of Helium, he said, but I do not recall your name.

And then I told him my story as I have written it here, omitting
only any reference to my love for Dejah Thoris.  He was much excited
by the news of Heliums princess and seemed quite positive that she
and Sola could easily have reached a point of safety from where they
left me.  He said that he knew the place well because the defile
through which the Warhoon warriors had passed when they discovered
us was the only one ever used by them when marching to the south.          end of pt1
