          Princess of Mars ch19 pt3          

Kantos Kan had been detailed to one of the small one man fliers
and had had the misfortune to be discovered by the Warhoons while
exploring their city.  The bravery and daring of the man won my
greatest respect and admiration.  Alone he had landed at the citys
boundary and on foot had penetrated to the buildings surrounding the
plaza.  For two days and nights he had explored their quarters and
their dungeons in search of his beloved princess only to fall into
the hands of a party of Warhoons as he was about to leave, after
assuring himself that Dejah Thoris was not a captive there.

During the period of our incarceration Kantos Kan and I became well
acquainted, and formed a warm personal friendship.  A few days only
elapsed, however, before we were dragged forth from our dungeon for
the great games.  We were conducted early one morning to an enormous
amphitheater, which instead of having been built upon the surface of
the ground was excavated below the surface.  It had partially filled
with debris so that how large it had originally been was difficult
to say.  In its present condition it held the entire twenty thousand
Warhoons of the assembled hordes.

The arena was immense but extremely uneven and unkempt.  Around
it the Warhoons had piled building stone from some of the ruined
edifices of the ancient city to prevent the animals and the
captives from escaping into the audience, and at each end had been
constructed cages to hold them until their turns came to meet some
horrible death upon the arena.

Kantos Kan and I were confined together in one of the cages.          end of pt3
