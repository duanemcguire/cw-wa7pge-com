          Princess of Mars ch1 pt1          CHAPTER I

ON THE ARIZONA HILLS

I am a very old man, how old I do not know.  Possibly I am a
hundred, possibly more, but I cannot tell because I have never aged
as other men, nor do I remember any childhood.  So far as I can
recollect I have always been a man, a man of about thirty.  I appear
today as I did forty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I
cannot go on living forever, that some day I shall die the real
death from which there is no resurrection.  I do not know why I
should fear death, I who have died twice and am still alive, but yet
I have the same horror of it as you who have never died, and it is
because of this terror of death, I believe, that I am so convinced
of my mortality.

And because of this conviction I have determined to write down the
story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death.  I
cannot explain the phenomena, I can only set down here in the words
of an ordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events
that befell me during the ten years that my dead body lay
undiscovered in an Arizona cave.          end of pt1
