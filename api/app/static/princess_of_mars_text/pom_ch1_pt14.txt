          Princess of Mars ch1 pt14            I found a large chamber, possibly a hundred
feet in diameter and thirty or forty feet in height, a smooth and
well worn floor, and many other evidences that the cave had, at some
remote period, been inhabited.  The back of the cave was so lost in
dense shadow that I could not distinguish whether there were
openings into other apartments or not.

As I was continuing my examination I commenced to feel a pleasant
drowsiness creeping over me which I attributed to the fatigue of my
long and strenuous ride, and the reaction from the excitement of the
fight and the pursuit.  I felt comparatively safe in my present
location as I knew that one man could defend the trail to the cave
against an army.

I soon became so drowsy that I could scarcely resist the strong
desire to throw myself on the floor of the cave for a few moments
rest, but I knew that this would never do, as it would mean certain
death at the hands of my red friends, who might be upon me at any
moment.  With an effort I started toward the opening of the cave
only to reel drunkenly against a side wall, and from there slip
prone upon the floor.          end of pt14
