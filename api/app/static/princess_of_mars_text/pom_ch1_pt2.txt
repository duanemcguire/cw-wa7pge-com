          Princess of Mars ch1 pt2          

I have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this
manuscript until after I have passed over for eternity.  I know that
the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so
I do not purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the
press, and held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the
simple truths which some day science will substantiate.  Possibly
the suggestions which I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I
can set down in this chronicle, will aid in an earlier understanding
of the mysteries of our sister planet, mysteries to you, but no
longer mysteries to me.

My name is John Carter, I am better known as Captain Jack Carter of
Virginia.  At the close of the Civil War I found myself possessed
of several hundred thousand dollars (Confederate) and a captains
commission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed,
the servant of a state which had vanished with the hopes of the
South.          end of pt2
