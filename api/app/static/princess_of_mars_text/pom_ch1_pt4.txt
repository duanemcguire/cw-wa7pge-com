On March 3, 1866, Powell and I packed his provisions on two of our
burros, and bidding me good bye he mounted his horse, and started
down the mountainside toward the valley, across which led the first
stage of his journey.

The morning of Powells departure was, like nearly all Arizona
mornings, clear and beautiful, I could see him and his little pack

sight of Powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the
shadows of the range on the opposite side of the valley.

and was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same
place I had last seen my friend and his two pack animals.          end of pt4
