          Princess of Mars ch1 pt7          

About nine oclock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to
proceed on my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail
at a fast walk, and in some places at a brisk trot until, about
midnight, I reached the water hole where Powell had expected to
camp.  I came upon the spot unexpectedly, finding it entirely
deserted, with no signs of having been recently occupied as a camp.

I was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen,
for such I was now convinced they must be, continued after Powell
with only a brief stop at the hole for water, and always at the same
rate of speed as his.

I was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they
wished to capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the
torture, so I urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace, hoping
against hope that I would catch up with the red rascals before they
attacked him.

Further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of
two shots far ahead of me.          end of pt7
