          Princess of Mars ch20 pt10            Instead of bothering with bolts and

These brothers, with their wives and children, occupied three
similar houses on this farm.  They did no work themselves, being
government officers in charge.  The labor was performed by convicts,
prisoners of war, delinquent debtors and confirmed bachelors who
were too poor to pay the high celibate tax which all red Martian
governments impose.

When they had heard my story I omitted all reference to Dejah

navy.

The chances are small that your tale will be believed until after

When I was ready to depart they furnished me with a small domestic
bull thoat, such as is used for saddle purposes by all red Martians.
The animal is about the size of a horse and quite gentle, but in
color and shape an exact replica of his huge and fierce cousin of
the wilds.          end of pt10
