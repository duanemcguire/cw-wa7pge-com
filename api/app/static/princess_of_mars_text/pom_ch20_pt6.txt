          Princess of Mars ch20 pt6            For eight hundred years, he
told me, he had watched these pumps which are used alternately a day
each at a stretch, or a little over twenty four and one half Earth
hours.  He has one assistant who divides the watch with him.  Half a
Martian year, about three hundred and forty four of our days, each
of these men spend alone in this huge, isolated plant.

Every red Martian is taught during earliest childhood the principles
of the manufacture of atmosphere, but only two at one time ever
hold the secret of ingress to the great building, which, built as
it is with walls a hundred and fifty feet thick, is absolutely
unassailable, even the roof being guarded from assault by air craft
by a glass covering five feet thick.

The only fear they entertain of attack is from the green Martians
or some demented red man, as all Barsoomians realize that the
very existence of every form of life of Mars is dependent upon
the uninterrupted working of this plant.

One curious fact I discovered as I watched his thoughts was that
the outer doors are manipulated by telepathic means.  The locks
are so finely adjusted that the doors are released by the action
of a certain combination of thought waves.  To experiment with
my new found toy I thought to surprise him into revealing this
combination and so I asked him in a casual manner how he had managed
to unlock the massive doors for me from the inner chambers of the
building.  As quick as a flash there leaped to his mind nine Martian
sounds, but as quickly faded as he answered that this was a secret
he must not divulge.

From then on his manner toward me changed as though he feared that
he had been surprised into divulging his great secret, and I read
suspicion and fear in his looks and thoughts, though his words were
still fair.          end of pt6
