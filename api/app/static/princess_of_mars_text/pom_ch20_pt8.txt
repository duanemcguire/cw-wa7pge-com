          Princess of Mars ch20 pt8            A wild scheme had come to me,
I would attempt to force the great locks by the nine thought waves
I had read in my hosts mind.

Creeping stealthily through corridor after corridor and down winding
runways which turned hither and thither I finally reached the great
hall in which I had broken my long fast that morning.  Nowhere had
I seen my host, nor did I know where he kept himself by night.

I was on the point of stepping boldly out into the room when a
slight noise behind me warned me back into the shadows of a recess
in the corridor.  Dragging Woola after me I crouched low in the
darkness.

Presently the old man passed close by me, and as he entered the
dimly lighted chamber which I had been about to pass through I
saw that he held a long thin dagger in his hand and that he was
sharpening it upon a stone.  In his mind was the decision to inspect
the radium pumps, which would take about thirty minutes, and then
return to my bed chamber and finish me.

As he passed through the great hall and disappeared down the runway
which led to the pump room, I stole stealthily from my hiding place
and crossed to the great door, the inner of the three which stood
between me and liberty.

Concentrating my mind upon the massive lock I hurled the nine
thought waves against it.  In breathless expectancy I waited, when
finally the great door moved softly toward me and slid quietly to
one side.  One after the other the remaining mighty portals opened
at my command and Woola and I stepped forth into the darkness, free,
but little better off than we had been before, other than that we
had full stomachs.          end of pt8
