          Princess of Mars ch20 pt9          

Hastening away from the shadows of the formidable pile I made for
the first crossroad, intending to strike the central turnpike as
quickly as possible.  This I reached about morning and entering
the first enclosure I came to I searched for some evidences of a
habitation.

There were low rambling buildings of concrete barred with heavy
impassable doors, and no amount of hammering and hallooing brought
any response.  Weary and exhausted from sleeplessness I threw
myself upon the ground commanding Woola to stand guard.

Some time later I was awakened by his frightful growlings and opened
my eyes to see three red Martians standing a short distance from us
and covering me with their rifles.

I am unarmed and no enemy, I hastened to explain.  I have been a
prisoner among the green men and am on my way to Zodanga.  All I ask
is food and rest for myself and my calot and the proper directions
for reaching my destination.

They lowered their rifles and advanced pleasantly toward me placing
their right hands upon my left shoulder, after the manner of their
custom of salute, and asking me many questions about myself and my
wanderings.  They then took me to the house of one of them which was
only a short distance away.

The buildings I had been hammering at in the early morning were
occupied only by stock and farm produce, the house proper standing
among a grove of enormous trees, and, like all red Martian homes,
had been raised at night some forty or fifty feet from the ground
on a large round metal shaft which slid up or down within a sleeve
sunk in the ground, and was operated by a tiny radium engine in the
entrance hall of the building.          end of pt9
