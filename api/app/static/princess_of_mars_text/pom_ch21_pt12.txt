          Princess of Mars ch21 pt12            The officer then recited the
nature of the heroic act which had won the approval of the jeddak,
and the latter advanced and placed a metal ornament upon the left
arm of the lucky man.

Ten men had been so decorated when the aide called out,

John Carter, air scout.

Never in my life had I been so surprised, but the habit of military
discipline is strong within me, and I dropped my little machine
lightly to the ground and advanced on foot as I had seen the others
do.  As I halted before the officer, he addressed me in a voice
audible to the entire assemblage of troops and spectators.

In recognition, John Carter, he said, of your remarkable courage
and skill in defending the person of the cousin of the jeddak Than
Kosis and, singlehanded, vanquishing three green warriors, it is the
pleasure of our jeddak to confer on you the mark of his esteem.

Than Kosis then advanced toward me and placing an ornament upon me,
said,

My cousin has narrated the details of your wonderful achievement,
which seems little short of miraculous, and if you can so well
defend a cousin of the jeddak how much better could you defend the
person of the jeddak himself.  You are therefore appointed a padwar
of The Guards and will be quartered in my palace hereafter.

I thanked him, and at his direction joined the members of his staff.
After the ceremony I returned my machine to its quarters on the roof
of the barracks of the air scout squadron, and with an orderly from
the palace to guide me I reported to the officer in charge of the
palace.
