affectionate farewell, promising him, however, that if I came

the means to search him out.

He seemed to understand me fully, and when I pointed back in the
direction of Thark he turned sorrowfully away, nor could I bear to
watch him go, but resolutely set my face toward Zodanga and with
a touch of heartsickness approached her frowning walls.

The letter I bore from them gained me immediate entrance to the

streets were practically deserted.  The residences, raised high

The Ptor brothers had given me explicit directions for reaching the
point of the city where I could find living accommodations and be
near the offices of the government agents to whom they had given me
letters.  My way led to the central square or plaza, which is a
