          Princess of Mars ch21 pt6            His reply was the
deadliest affront he could have put upon Than Kosis and the
Zodangans, but his people love him the more for it and his strength
in Helium is greater today than ever.

I have been here three days, continued Kantos Kan, but I have
not yet found where Dejah Thoris is imprisoned.  Today I join the
Zodangan navy as an air scout and I hope in this way to win the
confidence of Sab Than, the prince, who is commander of this
division of the navy, and thus learn the whereabouts of Dejah
Thoris.  I am glad that you are here, John Carter, for I know your
loyalty to my princess and two of us working together should be
able to accomplish much.

The plaza was now commencing to fill with people going and coming
upon the daily activities of their duties.  The shops were opening
and the cafes filling with early morning patrons.  Kantos Kan led me
to one of these gorgeous eating places where we were served entirely
by mechanical apparatus.  No hand touched the food from the time it
entered the building in its raw state until it emerged hot and
delicious upon the tables before the guests, in response to the
touching of tiny buttons to indicate their desires.

After our meal, Kantos Kan took me with him to the headquarters of
the air scout squadron and introducing me to his superior asked that
I be enrolled as a member of the corps.  In accordance with custom
an examination was necessary, but Kantos Kan had told me to have no
fear on this score as he would attend to that part of the matter.
He accomplished this by taking my order for examination to the
examining officer and representing himself as John Carter.          end of pt6
