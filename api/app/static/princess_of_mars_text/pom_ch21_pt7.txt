          Princess of Mars ch21 pt7          

This ruse will be discovered later, he cheerfully explained,
when they check up my weights, measurements, and other personal
identification data, but it will be several months before this is
done and our mission should be accomplished or have failed long
before that time.

The next few days were spent by Kantos Kan in teaching me
the intricacies of flying and of repairing the dainty little
contrivances which the Martians use for this purpose.  The body
of the one man air craft is about sixteen feet long, two feet wide
and three inches thick, tapering to a point at each end.  The driver
sits on top of this plane upon a seat constructed over the small,
noiseless radium engine which propels it.  The medium of buoyancy is
contained within the thin metal walls of the body and consists of
the eighth Barsoomian ray, or ray of propulsion, as it may be termed
in view of its properties.

This ray, like the ninth ray, is unknown on Earth, but the Martians
have discovered that it is an inherent property of all light no
matter from what source it emanates.  They have learned that it
is the solar eighth ray which propels the light of the sun to the
various planets, and that it is the individual eighth ray of each
planet which reflects, or propels the light thus obtained out
into space once more.  The solar eighth ray would be absorbed by the
surface of Barsoom, but the Barsoomian eighth ray, which tends to
propel light from Mars into space, is constantly streaming out from
the planet constituting a force of repulsion of gravity which when
confined is able to lift enormous weights from the surface of the
ground.          end of pt7
