          Princess of Mars ch22 pt10          

It is the work of Heliumites, said one of the men.

Yes, O Jeddak, but how had they access to the palace?  I could
believe that even with the diligent care of your guardsmen a single
enemy might reach the inner chambers, but how a force of six or
eight fighting men could have done so unobserved is beyond me.  We
shall soon know, however, for here comes the royal psychologist.

Another man now joined the group, and, after making his formal
greetings to his ruler, said,

O mighty Jeddak, it is a strange tale I read in the dead minds
of your faithful guardsmen.  They were felled not by a number
of fighting men, but by a single opponent.

He paused to let the full weight of this announcement impress his
hearers, and that his statement was scarcely credited was evidenced
by the impatient exclamation of incredulity which escaped the lips
of Than Kosis.

What manner of weird tale are you bringing me, Notan? he cried.

It is the truth, my Jeddak, replied the psychologist.  In fact
the impressions were strongly marked on the brain of each of the
four guardsmen.  Their antagonist was a very tall man, wearing the
metal of one of your own guardsmen, and his fighting ability was
little short of marvelous for he fought fair against the entire four
and vanquished them by his surpassing skill and superhuman strength
and endurance.  Though he wore the metal of Zodanga, my Jeddak, such
a man was never seen before in this or any other country upon
Barsoom.

The mind of the Princess of Helium whom I have examined and
questioned was a blank to me, she has perfect control, and I could
not read one iota of it.          end of pt10
