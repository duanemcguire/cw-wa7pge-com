          Princess of Mars ch22 pt11            She said that she witnessed a portion of
the encounter, and that when she looked there was but one man
engaged with the guardsmen, a man whom she did not recognize as
ever having seen.

Where is my erstwhile savior? spoke another of the party, and I
recognized the voice of the cousin of Than Kosis, whom I had rescued
from the green warriors.  By the metal of my first ancestor, he
went on, but the description fits him to perfection, especially as
to his fighting ability.

Where is this man? cried Than Kosis.  Have him brought to me at
once.  What know you of him, cousin?  It seemed strange to me now
that I think upon it that there should have been such a fighting man
in Zodanga, of whose name, even, we were ignorant before today.  And
his name too, John Carter, who ever heard of such a name upon
Barsoom.

Word was soon brought that I was nowhere to be found, either in the
palace or at my former quarters in the barracks of the air scout
squadron.  Kantos Kan, they had found and questioned, but he knew
nothing of my whereabouts, and as to my past, he had told them he
knew as little, since he had but recently met me during our
captivity among the Warhoons.

Keep your eyes on this other one, commanded Than Kosis.  He also
is a stranger and likely as not they both hail from Helium, and
where one is we shall sooner or later find the other.  Quadruple
the air patrol, and let every man who leaves the city by air or
ground be subjected to the closest scrutiny.

Another messenger now entered with word that I was still within the
palace walls.

The likeness of every person who has entered or left the palace
grounds today has been carefully examined, concluded the fellow,
and not one approaches the likeness of this new padwar of the
guards, other than that which was recorded of him at the time he
entered.          end of pt11
