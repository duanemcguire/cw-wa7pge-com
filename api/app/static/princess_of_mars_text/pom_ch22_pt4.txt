          Princess of Mars ch22 pt4            Walking boldly forward I pushed into the room
only to find myself in a small antechamber in which were the four
guards who had accompanied her.  One of them instantly arose and
accosted me, asking the nature of my business.

I am from Than Kosis, I replied, and wish to speak privately with
Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.

And your order? asked the fellow.

I did not know what he meant, but replied that I was a member of The
Guard, and without waiting for a reply from him I strode toward the
opposite door of the antechamber, behind which I could hear Dejah
Thoris conversing.

But my entrance was not to be so easily accomplished.  The guardsman
stepped before me, saying,

No one comes from Than Kosis without carrying an order or the
password.  You must give me one or the other before you may pass.

The only order I require, my friend, to enter where I will, hangs
at my side, I answered, tapping my long sword, will you let me
pass in peace or no?

For reply he whipped out his own sword, calling to the others to
join him, and thus the four stood, with drawn weapons, barring my
further progress.

You are not here by the order of Than Kosis, cried the one who had
first addressed me, and not only shall you not enter the apartments
of the Princess of Helium but you shall go back to Than Kosis under
guard to explain this unwarranted temerity.  Throw down your sword,
you cannot hope to overcome four of us, he added with a grim smile.

My reply was a quick thrust which left me but three antagonists and
I can assure you that they were worthy of my metal.  They had me
backed against the wall in no time, fighting for my life.          end of pt4
