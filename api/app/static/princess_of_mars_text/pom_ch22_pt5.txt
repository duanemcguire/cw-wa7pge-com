          Princess of Mars ch22 pt5            Slowly I
worked my way to a corner of the room where I could force them to
come at me only one at a time, and thus we fought upward of twenty
minutes, the clanging of steel on steel producing a veritable bedlam
in the little room.

The noise had brought Dejah Thoris to the door of her apartment,
and there she stood throughout the conflict with Sola at her back
peering over her shoulder.  Her face was set and emotionless and
I knew that she did not recognize me, nor did Sola.

Finally a lucky cut brought down a second guardsman and then, with
only two opposing me, I changed my tactics and rushed them down
after the fashion of my fighting that had won me many a victory.
The third fell within ten seconds after the second, and the last lay
dead upon the bloody floor a few moments later.  They were brave men
and noble fighters, and it grieved me that I had been forced to kill
them, but I would have willingly depopulated all Barsoom could I
have reached the side of my Dejah Thoris in no other way.

Sheathing my bloody blade I advanced toward my Martian Princess,
who still stood mutely gazing at me without sign of recognition.

Who are you, Zodangan? she whispered.  Another enemy to harass me
in my misery?

I am a friend, I answered, a once cherished friend.

No friend of Heliums princess wears that metal, she replied,
and yet the voice.  I have heard it before, it is not it cannot
be no, for he is dead.

It is, though, my Princess, none other than John Carter,
I said.  Do you not recognize, even through paint and strange
metal, the heart of your chieftain?

As I came close to her she swayed toward me with outstretched hands,
but as I reached to take her in my arms she drew back with a shudder
and a little moan of misery.          end of pt5
