          Princess of Mars ch22 pt7            It might have meant the fall of Helium, but
I would have given my empire for my Tharkian chief.

Then aloud she said, Do you remember the night when you offended
me?  You called me your princess without having asked my hand of me,
and then you boasted that you had fought for me.  You did not know,
and I should not have been offended, I see that now.  But there was
no one to tell you what I could not, that upon Barsoom there are two
kinds of women in the cities of the red men.  The one they fight for
that they may ask them in marriage, the other kind they fight for
also, but never ask their hands.  When a man has won a woman he may
address her as his princess, or in any of the several terms which
signify possession.  You had fought for me, but had never asked me
in marriage, and so when you called me your princess, you see, she
faltered, I was hurt, but even then, John Carter, I did not repulse
you, as I should have done, until you made it doubly worse by
taunting me with having won me through combat.

I do not need ask your forgiveness now, Dejah Thoris, I cried.
You must know that my fault was of ignorance of your Barsoomian
customs.  What I failed to do, through implicit belief that my
petition would be presumptuous and unwelcome, I do now, Dejah
Thoris, I ask you to be my wife, and by all the Virginian fighting
blood that flows in my veins you shall be.

No, John Carter, it is useless, she cried, hopelessly,
I may never be yours while Sab Than lives.

You have sealed his death warrant, my princess Sab Than dies.

Nor that either, she hastened to explain.          end of pt7
