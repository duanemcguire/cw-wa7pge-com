          Princess of Mars ch23 pt6          

As we neared the high tower a patrol shot down from above, throwing
its piercing searchlight full upon my craft, and a voice roared out
a command to halt, following with a shot as I paid no attention to
his hail.  Kantos Kan dropped quickly into the darkness, while I
rose steadily and at terrific speed raced through the Martian sky
followed by a dozen of the air scout craft which had joined the
pursuit, and later by a swift cruiser carrying a hundred men and
a battery of rapid fire guns.  By twisting and turning my little
machine, now rising and now falling, I managed to elude their
search lights most of the time, but I was also losing ground by
these tactics, and so I decided to hazard everything on a
straight away course and leave the result to fate and the speed
of my machine.

Kantos Kan had shown me a trick of gearing, which is known only
to the navy of Helium, that greatly increased the speed of our
machines, so that I felt sure I could distance my pursuers if
I could dodge their projectiles for a few moments.

As I sped through the air the screeching of the bullets around me
convinced me that only by a miracle could I escape, but the die was
cast, and throwing on full speed I raced a straight course toward
Helium.  Gradually I left my pursuers further and further behind,
and I was just congratulating myself on my lucky escape, when a
well directed shot from the cruiser exploded at the prow of my
little craft.  The concussion nearly capsized her, and with a
sickening plunge she hurtled downward through the dark night.

How far I fell before I regained control of the plane I do not know,
but I must have been very close to the ground when I started to rise
again, as I plainly heard the squealing of animals below me.          end of pt6
