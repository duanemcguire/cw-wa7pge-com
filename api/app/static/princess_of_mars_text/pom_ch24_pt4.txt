Strap him to that pillar, he shrieked.  We shall see who it is
dares strike the mighty Tal Hajus.  Heat the irons, with my own
hands I shall burn the eyes from his head that he may not pollute
my person with his vile gaze.

Chieftains of Thark, I cried, turning to the assembled council and
ignoring Tal Hajus, I have been a chief among you, and today I have
fought for Thark shoulder to shoulder with her greatest warrior.
You owe me, at least, a hearing.  I have won that much today.  You
claim to be just people 

Silence, roared Tal Hajus.  Gag the creature and bind him as I

Justice, Tal Hajus, exclaimed Lorquas Ptomel.  Who are you to set
aside the customs of ages among the Tharks.

Yes, justice. echoed a dozen voices, and so, while Tal Hajus fumed
and frothed, I continued.

You are a brave people and you love bravery, but where was your
mighty jeddak during the fighting today?  I did not see him in the
thick of battle, he was not there.  He rends defenseless women and
little children in his lair, but how recently has one of you seen

fashion their jeddaks?  There stands beside me now a great Thark,
a mighty warrior and a noble man.  Chieftains, how sounds, Tars
Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark?

A roar of deep toned applause greeted this suggestion.

It but remains for this council to command, and Tal Hajus must
prove his fitness to rule.  Were he a brave man he would invite Tars
Tarkas to combat, for he does not love him, but Tal Hajus is afraid,
Tal Hajus, your jeddak, is a coward.  With my bare hands I could
kill him, and he knows it.

After I ceased there was tense silence, as all eyes were riveted
upon Tal Hajus.  He did not speak or move, but the blotchy green of
his countenance turned livid, and the froth froze upon his lips.          end of pt4
