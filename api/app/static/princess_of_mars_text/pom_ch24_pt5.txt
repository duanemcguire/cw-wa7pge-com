          Princess of Mars ch24 pt5          

Tal Hajus, said Lorquas Ptomel in a cold, hard voice, never in my
long life have I seen a jeddak of the Tharks so humiliated.  There
could be but one answer to this arraignment.  We wait it.  And
still Tal Hajus stood as though electrified.

Chieftains, continued Lorquas Ptomel, shall the jeddak, Tal
Hajus, prove his fitness to rule over Tars Tarkas?

There were twenty chieftains about the rostrum, and twenty swords
flashed high in assent.

There was no alternative.  That decree was final, and so Tal Hajus
drew his long sword and advanced to meet Tars Tarkas.

The combat was soon over, and, with his foot upon the neck of the
dead monster, Tars Tarkas became jeddak among the Tharks.

His first act was to make me a full fledged chieftain with the rank
I had won by my combats the first few weeks of my captivity among
them.

Seeing the favorable disposition of the warriors toward Tars Tarkas,
as well as toward me, I grasped the opportunity to enlist them in
my cause against Zodanga.  I told Tars Tarkas the story of my
adventures, and in a few words had explained to him the thought
I had in mind.

John Carter has made a proposal, he said, addressing the council,
which meets with my sanction.  I shall put it to you briefly.
Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium, who was our prisoner, is now
held by the jeddak of Zodanga, whose son she must wed to save her
country from devastation at the hands of the Zodangan forces.

John Carter suggests that we rescue her and return her to Helium.
The loot of Zodanga would be magnificent, and I have often thought
that had we an alliance with the people of Helium we could obtain
sufficient assurance of sustenance to permit us to increase the size
and frequency of our hatchings, and thus become unquestionably
supreme among the green men of all Barsoom.  What say you?

It was a chance to fight, an opportunity to loot, and they rose to
the bait as a speckled trout to a fly.          end of pt5
