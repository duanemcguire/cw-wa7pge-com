          Princess of Mars ch24 pt8          

Dispatching one of my men to Tars Tarkas for a detail of fifty
Tharks, with word of my intentions, I ordered ten warriors to
capture and open one of the great gates while with the nine
remaining I took the other.  We were to do our work quietly, no
shots were to be fired and no general advance made until I had
reached the palace with my fifty Tharks.  Our plans worked to
perfection.  The two sentries we met were dispatched to their
fathers upon the banks of the lost sea of Korus, and the guards
at both gates followed them in silence.
