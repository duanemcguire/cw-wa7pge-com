          Princess of Mars ch26 pt6            The city had gone mad with joy.

My fierce Tharks caused the wildest excitement and enthusiasm.
Never before had an armed body of green warriors entered the gates
of Helium, and that they came now as friends and allies filled the
red men with rejoicing.

That my poor services to Dejah Thoris had become known to the
Heliumites was evidenced by the loud crying of my name, and by the
loads of ornaments that were fastened upon me and my huge thoat as
we passed up the avenues to the palace, for even in the face of the
ferocious appearance of Woola the populace pressed close about me.

As we approached this magnificent pile we were met by a party of
officers who greeted us warmly and requested that Tars Tarkas and
his jeds with the jeddaks and jeds of his wild allies, together with
myself, dismount and accompany them to receive from Tardos Mors an
expression of his gratitude for our services.

At the top of the great steps leading up to the main portals of the
palace stood the royal party, and as we reached the lower steps one
of their number descended to meet us.

He was an almost perfect specimen of manhood, tall, straight as an
arrow, superbly muscled and with the carriage and bearing of a ruler
of men.  I did not need to be told that he was Tardos Mors, Jeddak
of Helium.

The first member of our party he met was Tars Tarkas and his first
words sealed forever the new friendship between the races.

That Tardos Mors, he said, earnestly, may meet the greatest
living warrior of Barsoom is a priceless honor, but that he
may lay his hand on the shoulder of a friend and ally is a far
greater boon.

Jeddak of Helium, returned Tars Tarkas, it has remained for a man
of another world to teach the green warriors of Barsoom the meaning
of friendship, to him we owe the fact that the hordes of Thark can
understand you, that they can appreciate and reciprocate the
sentiments so graciously expressed.          end of pt6
