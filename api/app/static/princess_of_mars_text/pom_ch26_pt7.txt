          Princess of Mars ch26 pt7          

Tardos Mors then greeted each of the green jeddaks and jeds, and to
each spoke words of friendship and appreciation.

As he approached me he laid both hands upon my shoulders.

Welcome, my son, he said, that you are granted, gladly, and
without one word of opposition, the most precious jewel in all
Helium, yes, on all Barsoom, is sufficient earnest of my esteem.

We were then presented to Mors Kajak, Jed of lesser Helium, and
father of Dejah Thoris.  He had followed close behind Tardos Mors
and seemed even more affected by the meeting than had his father.

He tried a dozen times to express his gratitude to me, but his voice
choked with emotion and he could not speak, and yet he had, as I was
to later learn, a reputation for ferocity and fearlessness as a
fighter that was remarkable even upon warlike Barsoom.  In common
with all Helium he worshiped his daughter, nor could he think of
what she had escaped without deep emotion.
