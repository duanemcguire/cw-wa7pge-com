          Princess of Mars ch27 pt2          

Flashing the signals which proclaimed it a dispatch bearer for the
jeddak, it circled impatiently awaiting the tardy patrol boat which
must convoy it to the palace docks.

Ten minutes after it touched at the palace a message called me to
the council chamber, which I found filling with the members of that
body.

On the raised platform of the throne was Tardos Mors, pacing back
and forth with tense drawn face.  When all were in their seats he
turned toward us.

This morning, he said, word reached the several governments of
Barsoom that the keeper of the atmosphere plant had made no wireless
report for two days, nor had almost ceaseless calls upon him from a
score of capitals elicited a sign of response.

The ambassadors of the other nations asked us to take the matter
in hand and hasten the assistant keeper to the plant.  All day a
thousand cruisers have been searching for him until just now one
of them returns bearing his dead body, which was found in the pits
beneath his house horribly mutilated by some assassin.

I do not need to tell you what this means to Barsoom.  It would
take months to penetrate those mighty walls, in fact the work has
already commenced, and there would be little to fear were the engine
of the pumping plant to run as it should and as they all have for
hundreds of years now, but the worst, we fear, has happened.  The
instruments show a rapidly decreasing air pressure on all parts of
Barsoom the engine has stopped.

My gentlemen, he concluded, we have at best three days to live.

There was absolute silence for several minutes, and then a young
noble arose, and with his drawn sword held high above his head
addressed Tardos Mors.

The men of Helium have prided themselves that they have ever shown
Barsoom how a nation of red men should live, now is our opportunity
to show them how they should die.  Let us go about our duties as
though a thousand useful years still lay before us.          end of pt2
