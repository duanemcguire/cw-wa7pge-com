          Princess of Mars ch27 pt3          

The chamber rang with applause and as there was nothing better to
do than to allay the fears of the people by our example we went our
ways with smiles upon our faces and sorrow gnawing at our hearts.

When I returned to my palace I found that the rumor already had
reached Dejah Thoris, so I told her all that I had heard.

We have been very happy, John Carter, she said, and I thank
whatever fate overtakes us that it permits us to die together.

The next two days brought no noticeable change in the supply of air,
but on the morning of the third day breathing became difficult at
the higher altitudes of the rooftops.  The avenues and plazas of
Helium were filled with people.  All business had ceased.  For
the most part the people looked bravely into the face of their
unalterable doom.  Here and there, however, men and women gave
way to quiet grief.

Toward the middle of the day many of the weaker commenced to succumb
and within an hour the people of Barsoom were sinking by thousands
into the unconsciousness which precedes death by asphyxiation.

Dejah Thoris and I with the other members of the royal family had
collected in a sunken garden within an inner courtyard of the
palace.  We conversed in low tones, when we conversed at all, as
the awe of the grim shadow of death crept over us.  Even Woola
seemed to feel the weight of the impending calamity, for he
pressed close to Dejah Thoris and to me, whining pitifully.

The little incubator had been brought from the roof of our palace
at request of Dejah Thoris and now she sat gazing longingly upon
the unknown little life that now she would never know.

As it was becoming perceptibly difficult to breathe Tardos Mors
arose, saying,

Let us bid each other farewell.  The days of the greatness of
Barsoom are over.  Tomorrows sun will look down upon a dead world
which through all eternity must go swinging through the heavens
peopled not even by memories.          end of pt3
