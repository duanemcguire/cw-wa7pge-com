          Princess of Mars ch27 pt6            The Martian had
crawled to my side and with staring eyes fixed on the single panel
before us we waited in the silence of death.

Slowly the mighty door receded before us.  I attempted to rise and
follow it but I was too weak.

After it, I cried to my companion, and if you reach the pump room
turn loose all the pumps.  It is the only chance Barsoom has to
exist tomorrow.

From where I lay I opened the second door, and then the third, and
as I saw the hope of Barsoom crawling weakly on hands and knees
through the last doorway I sank unconscious upon the ground.
