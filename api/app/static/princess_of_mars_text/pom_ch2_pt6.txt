          Princess of Mars ch2 pt6          
I looked first at my lifeless clay there upon the floor of the cave
and then down at myself in utter bewilderment, for there I lay
clothed, and yet here I stood but naked as at the minute of my
birth.

The transition had been so sudden and so unexpected that it left me
for a moment forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis.
My first thought was, is this then death.  Have I indeed passed over
forever into that other life.  But I could not well believe this, as
I could feel my heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of
my efforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me.
My breath was coming in quick, short gasps, cold sweat stood out
from every pore of my body, and the ancient experiment of pinching
revealed the fact that I was anything other than a wraith.

Again was I suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by a
repetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave.          end of pt6
