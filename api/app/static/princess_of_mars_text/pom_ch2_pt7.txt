          Princess of Mars ch2 pt7            Naked and
unarmed as I was, I had no desire to face the unseen thing which
menaced me.

My revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which, for some
unfathomable reason, I could not bring myself to touch.  My carbine
was in its boot, strapped to my saddle, and as my horse had wandered
off I was left without means of defense.  My only alternative seemed
to lie in flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of
the rustling sound from the thing which now seemed, in the darkness
of the cave and to my distorted imagination, to be creeping
stealthily upon me.

Unable longer to resist the temptation to escape this horrible place
I leaped quickly through the opening into the starlight of a clear
Arizona night.  The crisp, fresh mountain air outside the cave acted
as an immediate tonic and I felt new life and new courage coursing
through me.  Pausing upon the brink of the ledge I upbraided myself
for what now seemed to me wholly unwarranted apprehension.          end of pt7
