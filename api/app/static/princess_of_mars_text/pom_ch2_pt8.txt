          Princess of Mars ch2 pt8            I
reasoned with myself that I had lain helpless for many hours within
the cave, yet nothing had molested me, and my better judgment, when
permitted the direction of clear and logical reasoning, convinced me
that the noises I had heard must have resulted from purely natural
and harmless causes, probably the conformation of the cave was such
that a slight breeze had caused the sounds I heard.

I decided to investigate, but first I lifted my head to fill my
lungs with the pure, invigorating night air of the mountains.  As I
did so I saw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky
gorge, and level, cacti studded flat, wrought by the moonlight into
a miracle of soft splendor and wondrous enchantment.

Few western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an
Arizona moonlit landscape, the silvered mountains in the distance,
the strange lights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo, and the
grotesque details of the stiff, yet beautiful cacti form a picture
at once enchanting and inspiring, as though one were catching for
the first time a glimpse of some dead and forgotten world, so
different is it from the aspect of any other spot upon our earth.          end of pt8
