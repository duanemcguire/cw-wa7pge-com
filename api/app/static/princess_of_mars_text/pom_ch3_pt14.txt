          Princess of Mars ch3 pt14            The throwing down of his weapons and the
withdrawing of his troop before his advance toward me would have
signified a peaceful mission anywhere on Earth, so why not, then,
on Mars.

Placing my hand over my heart I bowed low to the Martian and
explained to him that while I did not understand his language, his
actions spoke for the peace and friendship that at the present
moment were most dear to my heart.  Of course I might have been a
babbling brook for all the intelligence my speech carried to him,
but he understood the action with which I immediately followed my
words.

Stretching my hand toward him, I advanced and took the armlet from
his open palm, clasping it about my arm above the elbow, smiled at
him and stood waiting.  His wide mouth spread into an answering
smile, and locking one of his intermediary arms in mine we turned
and walked back toward his mount.  At the same time he motioned his
followers to advance.          end of pt14
