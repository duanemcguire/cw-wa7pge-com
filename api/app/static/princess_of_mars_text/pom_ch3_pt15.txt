          Princess of Mars ch3 pt15            They started toward us on a wild run, but
were checked by a signal from him.  Evidently he feared that were
I to be really frightened again I might jump entirely out of the
landscape.

He exchanged a few words with his men, motioned to me that I would
ride behind one of them, and then mounted his own animal.  The
fellow designated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up
behind him on the glossy back of his mount, where I hung on as best
I could by the belts and straps which held the Martians weapons and
ornaments.

The entire cavalcade then turned and galloped away toward the range
of hills in the distance.
