          Princess of Mars ch3 pt4            The eggs were nearly uniform
in size being about two and one half feet in diameter.

Five or six had already hatched and the grotesque caricatures which
sat blinking in the sunlight were enough to cause me to doubt my
sanity.  They seemed mostly head, with little scrawny bodies, long
necks and six legs, or, as I afterward learned, two legs and two
arms, with an intermediary pair of limbs which could be used at will
either as arms or legs.  Their eyes were set at the extreme sides of
their heads a trifle above the center and protruded in such a manner
that they could be directed either forward or back and also
independently of each other, thus permitting this queer animal to
look in any direction, or in two directions at once, without the
necessity of turning the head.

The ears, which were slightly above the eyes and closer together,
were small, cup shaped antennae, protruding not more than an inch on
these young specimens.          end of pt4
