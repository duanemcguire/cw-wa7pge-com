          Princess of Mars ch3 pt6          

Most of these details I noted later, for I was given but little time
to speculate on the wonders of my new discovery.  I had seen that
the eggs were in the process of hatching, and as I stood watching
the hideous little monsters break from their shells I failed to note
the approach of a score of full grown Martians from behind me.

Coming, as they did, over the soft and soundless moss, which covers
practically the entire surface of Mars with the exception of the
frozen areas at the poles and the scattered cultivated districts,
they might have captured me easily, but their intentions were far
more sinister.  It was the rattling of the accouterments of the
foremost warrior which warned me.

On such a little thing my life hung that I often marvel that I
escaped so easily.  Had not the rifle of the leader of the party
swung from its fastenings beside his saddle in such a way as to
strike against the butt of his great metal shod spear I should have
snuffed out without ever knowing that death was near me.          end of pt6
