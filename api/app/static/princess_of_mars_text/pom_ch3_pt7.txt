          Princess of Mars ch3 pt7            But the
little sound caused me to turn, and there upon me, not ten feet
from my breast, was the point of that huge spear, a spear forty
feet long, tipped with gleaming metal, and held low at the side
of a mounted replica of the little devils I had been watching.

But how puny and harmless they now looked beside this huge and
terrific incarnation of hate, of vengeance and of death.  The man
himself, for such I may call him, was fully fifteen feet in height
and, on Earth, would have weighed some four hundred pounds.  He sat
his mount as we sit a horse, grasping the animals barrel with his
lower limbs, while the hands of his two right arms held his immense
spear low at the side of his mount, his two left arms were
outstretched laterally to help preserve his balance, the thing he
rode having neither bridle or reins of any description for guidance.

And his mount.  How can earthly words describe it.          end of pt7
