          Princess of Mars ch3 pt8            It towered ten
feet at the shoulder, had four legs on either side, a broad flat
tail, larger at the tip than at the root, and which it held straight
out behind while running, a gaping mouth which split its head from
its snout to its long, massive neck.

Like its master, it was entirely devoid of hair, but was of a dark

and its legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a
vivid yellow at the feet.  The feet themselves were heavily padded
and nailless, which fact had also contributed to the noiselessness
of their approach, and, in common with a multiplicity of legs, is a
characteristic feature of the fauna of Mars.  The highest type of
man and one other animal, the only mammal existing on Mars, alone
have well formed nails, and there are absolutely no hoofed animals
in existence there.

Behind this first charging demon trailed nineteen others, similar
in all respects, but, as I learned later, bearing individual
