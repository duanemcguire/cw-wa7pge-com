          Princess of Mars ch4 pt10            Tars Tarkas advanced toward me, holding out
one of his arms, and we thus proceeded to the plaza without further
mishap.  I did not, of course, know the reason for which we had come
to the open, but I was not long in being enlightened.  They first
repeated the word sak a number of times, and then Tars Tarkas made
several jumps, repeating the same word before each leap, then,
turning to me, he said, sak.  I saw what they were after, and
gathering myself together I sakked with such marvelous success
that I cleared a good hundred and fifty feet, nor did I this time,
lose my equilibrium, but landed squarely upon my feet without
falling.  I then returned by easy jumps of twenty five or thirty
feet to the little group of warriors.

My exhibition had been witnessed by several hundred lesser Martians,
and they immediately broke into demands for a repetition, which the
chieftain then ordered me to make, but I was both hungry and
thirsty, and determined on the spot that my only method of salvation
was to demand the consideration from these creatures which they
evidently would not voluntarily accord.          end of pt10
