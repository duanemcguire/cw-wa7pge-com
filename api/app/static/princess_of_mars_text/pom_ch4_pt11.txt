repeated commands to sak, and each time they were made I motioned
to my mouth and rubbed my stomach.

Tars Tarkas and the chief exchanged a few words, and the former,
calling to a young female among the throng, gave her some
instructions and motioned me to accompany her.  I grasped her
proffered arm and together we crossed the plaza toward a large
building on the far side.

My fair companion was about eight feet tall, having just arrived
at maturity, but not yet to her full height.  She was of a light
olive green color, with a smooth, glossy hide.  Her name, as I
afterward learned, was Sola, and she belonged to the retinue of
Tars Tarkas.  She conducted me to a spacious chamber in one of the
buildings fronting on the plaza, and which, from the litter of
silks and furs upon the floor, I took to be the sleeping quarters
of several of the natives.

The room was well lighted by a number of large windows and was
beautifully decorated with mural paintings and mosaics, but upon
all there seemed to rest that indefinable touch of the finger of
antiquity which convinced me that the architects and builders of
these wondrous creations had nothing in common with the crude
half brutes which now occupied them.          end of pt11
