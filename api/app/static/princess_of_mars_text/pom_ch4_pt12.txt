          Princess of Mars ch4 pt12          

Sola motioned me to be seated upon a pile of silks near the center
of the room, and, turning, made a peculiar hissing sound, as though
signaling to someone in an adjoining room.  In response to her call
I obtained my first sight of a new Martian wonder.  It waddled in
on its ten short legs, and squatted down before the girl like an
obedient puppy.  The thing was about the size of a Shetland pony,
but its head bore a slight resemblance to that of a frog, except
that the jaws were equipped with three rows of long, sharp tusks.
