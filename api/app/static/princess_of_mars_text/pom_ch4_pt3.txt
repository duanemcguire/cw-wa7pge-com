          Princess of Mars ch4 pt3          

Only about one Martian in a thousand dies of sickness or disease,
and possibly about twenty take the voluntary pilgrimage.  The other
nine hundred and seventy nine die violent deaths in duels, in
hunting, in aviation and in war, but perhaps by far the greatest
death loss comes during the age of childhood, when vast numbers of
the little Martians fall victims to the great white apes of Mars.

The average life expectancy of a Martian after the age of maturity
is about three hundred years, but would be nearer the one thousand
mark were it not for the various means leading to violent death.
Owing to the waning resources of the planet it evidently became
necessary to counteract the increasing longevity which their
remarkable skill in therapeutics and surgery produced, and so human
life has come to be considered but lightly on Mars, as is evidenced
by their dangerous sports and the almost continual warfare between
the various communities.          end of pt3
