          Princess of Mars ch4 pt7          

My captor, whose name was Tars Tarkas, was virtually the
vice chieftain of the community, and a man of great ability as a
statesman and warrior.  He evidently explained briefly the incidents
connected with his expedition, including my capture, and when he had
concluded the chieftain addressed me at some length.

I replied in our good old English tongue merely to convince him that
neither of us could understand the other, but I noticed that when I
smiled slightly on concluding, he did likewise.  This fact, and the
similar occurrence during my first talk with Tars Tarkas, convinced
me that we had at least something in common, the ability to smile,
therefore to laugh, denoting a sense of humor.  But I was to learn
that the Martian smile is merely perfunctory, and that the Martian
laugh is a thing to cause strong men to blanch in horror.

The ideas of humor among the green men of Mars are widely at
variance with our conceptions of incitants to merriment.          end of pt7
