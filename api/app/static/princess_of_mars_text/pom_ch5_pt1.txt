          Princess of Mars ch5 pt1          CHAPTER V

I ELUDE MY WATCH DOG

Sola stared into the brutes wicked looking eyes, muttered a word or
two of command, pointed to me, and left the chamber.  I could not but
wonder what this ferocious looking monstrosity might do when left
alone in such close proximity to such a relatively tender morsel of
meat, but my fears were groundless, as the beast, after surveying me
intently for a moment, crossed the room to the only exit which led
to the street, and lay down full length across the threshold.

This was my first experience with a Martian watch dog, but it was
destined not to be my last, for this fellow guarded me carefully
during the time I remained a captive among these green men, twice
saving my life, and never voluntarily being away from me a moment.

While Sola was away I took occasion to examine more minutely the
room in which I found myself captive.  The mural painting depicted
scenes of rare and wonderful beauty, mountains, rivers, lake,
ocean, meadow, trees and flowers, winding roadways, sun kissed
gardens scenes which might have portrayed earthly views but for
the different colorings of the vegetation.          end of pt1
