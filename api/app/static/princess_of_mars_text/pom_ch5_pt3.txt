          Princess of Mars ch5 pt3            A single plant of this species will give eight or ten
quarts of milk per day.

After I had eaten I was greatly invigorated, but feeling the need
of rest I stretched out upon the silks and was soon asleep.  I must
have slept several hours, as it was dark when I awoke, and I was
very cold.  I noticed that someone had thrown a fur over me, but it
had become partially dislodged and in the darkness I could not see
to replace it.  Suddenly a hand reached out and pulled the fur over
me, shortly afterwards adding another to my covering.

I presumed that my watchful guardian was Sola, nor was I wrong.
This girl alone, among all the green Martians with whom I came in
contact, disclosed characteristics of sympathy, kindliness, and
affection, her ministrations to my bodily wants were unfailing, and
her solicitous care saved me from much suffering and many hardships.

As I was to learn, the Martian nights are extremely cold, and as
there is practically no twilight or dawn, the changes in temperature
are sudden and most uncomfortable, as are the transitions from
brilliant daylight to darkness.          end of pt3
