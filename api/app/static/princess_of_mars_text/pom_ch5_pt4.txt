          Princess of Mars ch5 pt4            The nights are either brilliantly
illumined or very dark, for if neither of the two moons of Mars
happen to be in the sky almost total darkness results, since the
lack of atmosphere, or, rather, the very thin atmosphere, fails to
diffuse the starlight to any great extent, on the other hand, if
both of the moons are in the heavens at night the surface of the
ground is brightly illuminated.

Both of Mars moons are vastly nearer her than is our moon to Earth,
the nearer moon being but about five thousand miles distant, while
the further is but little more than fourteen thousand miles away,
against the nearly one quarter million miles which separate us from
our moon.  The nearer moon of Mars makes a complete revolution
around the planet in a little over seven and one half hours, so that
she may be seen hurtling through the sky like some huge meteor two
or three times each night, revealing all her phases during each
transit of the heavens.          end of pt4
