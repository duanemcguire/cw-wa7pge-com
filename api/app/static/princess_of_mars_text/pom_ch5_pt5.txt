          Princess of Mars ch5 pt5          

The further moon revolves about Mars in something over thirty and
one quarter hours, and with her sister satellite makes a nocturnal
Martian scene one of splendid and weird grandeur.  And it is well
that nature has so graciously and abundantly lighted the Martian
night, for the green men of Mars, being a nomadic race without
high intellectual development, have but crude means for artificial
lighting, depending principally upon torches, a kind of candle, and
a peculiar oil lamp which generates a gas and burns without a wick.

This last device produces an intensely brilliant far reaching white
light, but as the natural oil which it requires can only be obtained
by mining in one of several widely separated and remote localities
it is seldom used by these creatures whose only thought is for
today, and whose hatred for manual labor has kept them in a
semi barbaric state for countless ages.

After Sola had replenished my coverings I again slept, nor did I
awaken until daylight.          end of pt5
