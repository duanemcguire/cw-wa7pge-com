          Princess of Mars ch5 pt6            The other occupants of the room, five in
number, were all females, and they were still sleeping, piled high
with a motley array of silks and furs.  Across the threshold lay
stretched the sleepless guardian brute, just as I had last seen him
on the preceding day, apparently he had not moved a muscle, his eyes
were fairly glued upon me, and I fell to wondering just what might
befall me should I endeavor to escape.

I have ever been prone to seek adventure and to investigate and
experiment where wiser men would have left well enough alone.  It
therefore now occurred to me that the surest way of learning the
exact attitude of this beast toward me would be to attempt to leave
the room.  I felt fairly secure in my belief that I could escape him
should he pursue me once I was outside the building, for I had begun
to take great pride in my ability as a jumper.  Furthermore, I could
see from the shortness of his legs that the brute himself was no
jumper and probably no runner.          end of pt6
