          Princess of Mars ch5 pt9            My exultation was short lived, however, for scarcely
had I gained a secure seat upon the sill than a huge hand grasped
me by the neck from behind and dragged me violently into the room.
Here I was thrown upon my back, and beheld standing over me a
colossal ape like creature, white and hairless except for an
enormous shock of bristly hair upon its head.
