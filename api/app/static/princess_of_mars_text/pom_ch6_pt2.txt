          Princess of Mars ch6 pt2          

As quickly as possible I gained my feet and backing against the wall
I witnessed such a battle as it is vouchsafed few beings to see.
The strength, agility, and blind ferocity of these two creatures
is approached by nothing known to earthly man.  My beast had an
advantage in his first hold, having sunk his mighty fangs far into
the breast of his adversary, but the great arms and paws of the ape,
backed by muscles far transcending those of the Martian men I had
seen, had locked the throat of my guardian and slowly were choking
out his life, and bending back his head and neck upon his body,
where I momentarily expected the former to fall limp at the end of
a broken neck.

In accomplishing this the ape was tearing away the entire front of
its breast, which was held in the vise like grip of the powerful
jaws.  Back and forth upon the floor they rolled, neither one
emitting a sound of fear or pain.  Presently I saw the great eyes
of my beast bulging completely from their sockets and blood flowing
from its nostrils.  That he was weakening perceptibly was evident,
but so also was the ape, whose struggles were growing momentarily
less.          end of pt2
