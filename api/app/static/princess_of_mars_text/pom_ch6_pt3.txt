          Princess of Mars ch6 pt3          

Suddenly I came to myself and, with that strange instinct which
seems ever to prompt me to my duty, I seized the cudgel, which had
fallen to the floor at the commencement of the battle, and swinging
it with all the power of my earthly arms I crashed it full upon the
head of the ape, crushing his skull as though it had been an
eggshell.

Scarcely had the blow descended when I was confronted with a new
danger.  The apes mate, recovered from its first shock of terror,
had returned to the scene of the encounter by way of the interior
of the building.  I glimpsed him just before he reached the doorway
and the sight of him, now roaring as he perceived his lifeless
fellow stretched upon the floor, and frothing at the mouth, in the
extremity of his rage, filled me, I must confess, with dire
forebodings.

I am ever willing to stand and fight when the odds are not too
overwhelmingly against me, but in this instance I perceived neither
glory nor profit in pitting my relatively puny strength against
the iron muscles and brutal ferocity of this enraged denizen of an
unknown world, in fact, the only outcome of such an encounter, so
far as I might be concerned, seemed sudden death.          end of pt3
