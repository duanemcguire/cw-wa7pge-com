          Princess of Mars ch6 pt4          

I was standing near the window and I knew that once in the street I
might gain the plaza and safety before the creature could overtake
me, at least there was a chance for safety in flight, against almost
certain death should I remain and fight however desperately.

It is true I held the cudgel, but what could I do with it against
his four great arms?  Even should I break one of them with my first
blow, for I figured that he would attempt to ward off the cudgel,
he could reach out and annihilate me with the others before I could
recover for a second attack.

In the instant that these thoughts passed through my mind I had
turned to make for the window, but my eyes alighting on the form
of my erstwhile guardian threw all thoughts of flight to the four
winds.  He lay gasping upon the floor of the chamber, his great eyes
fastened upon me in what seemed a pitiful appeal for protection.  I
could not withstand that look, nor could I, on second thought, have
deserted my rescuer without giving as good an account of myself in
his behalf as he had in mine.

Without more ado, therefore, I turned to meet the charge of the
infuriated bull ape.          end of pt4
