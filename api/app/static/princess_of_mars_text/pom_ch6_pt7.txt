          Princess of Mars ch6 pt7            Satisfying herself that I had come off unscathed she
smiled quietly, and, taking my hand, started toward the door of
the chamber.

Tars Tarkas and the other warriors had entered and were standing
over the now rapidly reviving brute which had saved my life, and
whose life I, in turn, had rescued.  They seemed to be deep in
argument, and finally one of them addressed me, but remembering
my ignorance of his language turned back to Tars Tarkas, who, with
a word and gesture, gave some command to the fellow and turned to
follow us from the room.

There seemed something menacing in their attitude toward my beast,
and I hesitated to leave until I had learned the outcome.  It was
well I did so, for the warrior drew an evil looking pistol from its
holster and was on the point of putting an end to the creature when
I sprang forward and struck up his arm.  The bullet striking the
wooden casing of the window exploded, blowing a hole completely
through the wood and masonry.

I then knelt down beside the fearsome looking thing, and raising it
to its feet motioned for it to follow me.  The looks of surprise
which my actions elicited from the Martians were ludicrous, they
could not understand, except in a feeble and childish way, such
attributes as gratitude and compassion.          end of pt7
