plaza, where I found the entire community engaged in watching or
helping at the harnessing of huge mastodonian animals to great
three wheeled chariots.  There were about two hundred and fifty of
these vehicles, each drawn by a single animal, any one of which,
from their appearance, might easily have drawn the entire wagon
train when fully loaded.

The chariots themselves were large, commodious, and gorgeously
decorated.  In each was seated a female Martian loaded with
ornaments of metal, with jewels and silks and furs, and upon the
