          Princess of Mars ch7 pt10            Likewise, under Solas
tutelage, I developed my telepathic powers so that I shortly could
sense practically everything that went on around me.

What surprised Sola most in me was that while I could catch
telepathic messages easily from others, and often when they were
not intended for me, no one could read a jot from my mind under any
circumstances.  At first this vexed me, but later I was very glad
of it, as it gave me an undoubted advantage over the Martians.
