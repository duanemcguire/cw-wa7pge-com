          Princess of Mars ch7 pt2            It is the
universal language of Mars, through the medium of which the higher
and lower animals of this world of paradoxes are able to communicate
to a greater or less extent, depending upon the intellectual sphere
of the species and the development of the individual.

As the cavalcade took up the line of march in single file, Sola
dragged me into an empty chariot and we proceeded with the
procession toward the point by which I had entered the city the
day before.  At the head of the caravan rode some two hundred
warriors, five abreast, and a like number brought up the rear,
while twenty five or thirty outriders flanked us on either side.

Every one but myself men, women, and children were heavily armed,
and at the tail of each chariot trotted a Martian hound, my own
beast following closely behind ours, in fact, the faithful creature
never left me voluntarily during the entire ten years I spent on
Mars.  Our way led out across the little valley before the city,
through the hills, and down into the dead sea bottom which I had
traversed on my journey from the incubator to the plaza.  The
incubator, as it proved, was the terminal point of our journey this
day, and, as the entire cavalcade broke into a mad gallop as soon
as we reached the level expanse of sea bottom, we were soon within
sight of our goal.          end of pt2
