          Princess of Mars ch8 pt2            I could see figures crowding
the forward decks and upper works of the air craft.  Whether they
had discovered us or simply were looking at the deserted city I
could not say, but in any event they received a rude reception,
for suddenly and without warning the green Martian warriors fired a
terrific volley from the windows of the buildings facing the little
valley across which the great ships were so peacefully advancing.

Instantly the scene changed as by magic, the foremost vessel swung
broadside toward us, and bringing her guns into play returned our
fire, at the same time moving parallel to our front for a short
distance and then turning back with the evident intention of
completing a great circle which would bring her up to position once
more opposite our firing line, the other vessels followed in her
wake, each one opening upon us as she swung into position.  Our own
fire never diminished, and I doubt if twenty five per cent of our
shots went wild.  It had never been given me to see such deadly
accuracy of aim, and it seemed as though a little figure on one of
the craft dropped at the explosion of each bullet, while the banners
and upper works dissolved in spurts of flame as the irresistible
projectiles of our warriors mowed through them.          end of pt2
