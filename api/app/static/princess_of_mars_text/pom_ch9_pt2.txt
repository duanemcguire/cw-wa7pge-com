          Princess of Mars ch9 pt2          

The training of myself and the young Martians was conducted solely
by the women, who not only attend to the education of the young
in the arts of individual defense and offense, but are also the
artisans who produce every manufactured article wrought by the
green Martians.  They make the powder, the cartridges, the firearms,
in fact everything of value is produced by the females.  In time
of actual warfare they form a part of the reserves, and when the
necessity arises fight with even greater intelligence and ferocity
than the men.

The men are trained in the higher branches of the art of war, in
strategy and the maneuvering of large bodies of troops.  They make
the laws as they are needed, a new law for each emergency.  They are
unfettered by precedent in the administration of justice.  Customs
have been handed down by ages of repetition, but the punishment for
ignoring a custom is a matter for individual treatment by a jury of
the culprits peers, and I may say that justice seldom misses fire,
but seems rather to rule in inverse ratio to the ascendency of law.
In one respect at least the Martians are a happy people, they have
no lawyers.          end of pt2
