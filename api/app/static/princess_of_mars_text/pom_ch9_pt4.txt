          Princess of Mars ch9 pt4            After they had
retired for the night it was customary for the adults to carry on a
desultory conversation for a short time before lapsing into sleep,
and now that I could understand their language I was always a keen
listener, although I never proffered any remarks myself.

On the night following the prisoners visit to the audience chamber
the conversation finally fell upon this subject, and I was all ears
on the instant.  I had feared to question Sola relative to the
beautiful captive, as I could not but recall the strange expression
I had noted upon her face after my first encounter with the
prisoner.  That it denoted jealousy I could not say, and yet,
judging all things by mundane standards as I still did, I felt it
safer to affect indifference in the matter until I learned more
surely Solas attitude toward the object of my solicitude.

Sarkoja, one of the older women who shared our domicile, had been
present at the audience as one of the captives guards, and it
was toward her the question turned.

When, asked one of the women, will we enjoy the death throes of
the red one? or does Lorquas Ptomel, Jed, intend holding her for
ransom?

They have decided to carry her with us back to Thark, and exhibit
her last agonies at the great games before Tal Hajus, replied
Sarkoja.          end of pt4
