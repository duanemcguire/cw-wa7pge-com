          Princess of Mars ch9 pt7          

I did not even know that there were any better conditions to escape
to, but I was more than willing to take my chances among people
fashioned after my own mold rather than to remain longer among the
hideous and bloodthirsty green men of Mars.  But where to go, and
how, was as much of a puzzle to me as the age old search for the
spring of eternal life has been to earthly men since the beginning
of time.

I decided that at the first opportunity I would take Sola into my
confidence and openly ask her to aid me, and with this resolution
strong upon me I turned among my silks and furs and slept the
dreamless and refreshing sleep of Mars.
