FOREWORD

To the Reader of this Work,

In submitting Captain Carters strange manuscript to you in book
form, I believe that a few words relative to this remarkable
personality will be of interest.

My first recollection of Captain Carter is of the few months he
spent at my fathers home in Virginia, just prior to the opening of
the civil war.  I was then a child of but five years, yet I well
remember the tall, dark, smooth faced, athletic man whom I called
Uncle Jack.

He seemed always to be laughing, and he entered into the sports
of the children with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed
toward those pastimes in which the men and women of his own age
indulged, or he would sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old
grandmother with stories of his strange, wild life in all parts of
the world.  We all loved him, and our slaves fairly worshipped the
ground he trod.          end of pt1
