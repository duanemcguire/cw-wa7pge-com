          Princess of Mars foreword pt3            He was, when
others were with him, the same genial, happy fellow we had known of
old, but when he thought himself alone I have seen him sit for
hours gazing off into space, his face set in a look of wistful
longing and hopeless misery, and at night he would sit thus looking
up into the heavens, at what I did not know until I read his
manuscript years afterward.

He told us that he had been prospecting and mining in Arizona part
of the time since the war, and that he had been very successful
was evidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was
supplied.  As to the details of his life during these years he
was very reticent, in fact he would not talk of them at all.

He remained with us for about a year and then went to New York,
where he purchased a little place on the Hudson, where I visited
him once a year on the occasions of my trips to the New York
market my father and I owning and operating a string of general
stores throughout Virginia at that time.          end of pt3
