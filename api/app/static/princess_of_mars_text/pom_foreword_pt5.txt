          Princess of Mars foreword pt5            I had always been his favorite among the
younger generation of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his
demand.

I arrived at the little station, about a mile from his grounds, on
the morning of March 4, 1886, and when I asked the livery man to
drive me out to Captain Carters he replied that if I was a friend
of the Captains he had some very bad news for me, the Captain had
been found dead shortly after daylight that very morning by the
watchman attached to an adjoining property.

For some reason this news did not surprise me, but I hurried out to
his place as quickly as possible, so that I could take charge of the
body and of his affairs.

I found the watchman who had discovered him, together with the local
police chief and several townspeople, assembled in his little study.
The watchman related the few details connected with the finding of
the body, which he said had been still warm when he came upon it.          end of pt5
