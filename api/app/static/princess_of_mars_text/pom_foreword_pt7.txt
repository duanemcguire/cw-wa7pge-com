          Princess of Mars foreword pt7            The instructions impressed upon me that I must
personally see that this was carried out just as he directed,
even in secrecy if necessary.

His property was left in such a way that I was to receive the
entire income for twenty five years, when the principal was to
become mine. His further instructions related to this manuscript
which I was to retain sealed and unread, just as I found it, for
eleven years, nor was I to divulge its contents until twenty one
years after his death.

A strange feature about the tomb, where his body still lies, is
that the massive door is equipped with a single, huge gold plated
spring lock which can be opened _only from the inside_.

Yours very sincerely,

Edgar Rice Burroughs.
