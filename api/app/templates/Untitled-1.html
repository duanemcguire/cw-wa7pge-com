<h3>Practice Tool: <a href="/phrases/ttr" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #f78787">Word Building/TTR</a></h3>
<p>
The Word Building/Time to Recognize (TTR) tool presents just words in a random, continuous stream.  The tool encourages you to maintain a forward focus.   Maintaining a forward focus, and suppressing thoughts of missed characters is an essential skill on the path to fluency.   

<B>Difficulty Level</B>: Set a difficulty level that enhances your training, one where you are missing some, but not all (that's the sweet spot for training progress).  Difficulty may be set with four different controls: 
<ul>
    <li>Word Collection (easy or hard words)</li>
    <li>WPM</li>
    <li>Repetitions</li>
    <li>Word Spacing</li>
</ul> 

<b>Word Building and Time to Recognize</b>:  Naturally, the time you take to recognize characters and assemble words will determine your Morse Code top speed.  Our amazing brains perform multiple functions simultaneously. As such guaging our progress in Time to Recognize (TTR) is best done in the context of word building and recognition.  This provides exactly that.  For the combination of WPM and word spacing you choose, the time between words is displayed.   For instance, 20 WPM with standard word spacing allows for 420 milliseconds between words.   In this exercise when consistently acheive recognition before the next word starts, then the word spacing time displayed is your current time to recognize.  Note that a higher WPM speed with more word spacing could represent a similar TTR. 

<b>Project Overlearn</b>:  The tool complements the word building exercises of Project Overlearn. You can create exercises that meet or challenge your learning level by varying the four controls of difficulty level.
