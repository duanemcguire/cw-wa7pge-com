<h3>Preface</h3>    
The CW practice tools complement the Morse Code learning curriculum of the Long Island CW Club.  Full details of the curriculum are found in the <a href="https://longislandcwclub.org/academic-downloads/#3ee5f2daa0d818959">LICW Student and Instructor Guide</a>.  Students enter the Intermediate level after they have acheived aural recognition of Morse Code characters.  At the Intermediate level, students can expect they will: <BR><BR>
<ul>
<li>Develop intuitive processing of character sequences to enable receiving conversational code and relaxed copy of common words.
<i>(Intermediate 1: 12 WPM)</i>    
</li>
<li>Build cognitive efficiency as speeds increase while reducing Time to Recognize (TTR) and training for Instant Flow Recovery(IFR).<i>(Intermediate 2: 12-16 WPM)</i>
</li>    
    <li>Shift from consciously constructing words (word building) to intuitively perceiving them (word discovery). <i>(Intermediate 3: 16-20 WPM)</i></li>
    </ul>

<h3>Practice Tool: <a href="/phrases/" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #f78787">Phrase Copy</a></h3>
<p>
The Phrase Copy Practice tool randomly presents phrases and words from a variety of categories, e.g.    Words, Brand Slogans, Common Phrases, Song Titles, etc.  The user may select difficulty level by varying the speed of the code.  These exercises are very appropriate to the Intermediate 1 student, when focused on recognition of words and phrases.   The tool allows the user to listen to the word or phrase as many times as desired, and will reveal the phrase visually on request. 
</p><p>
The <B>simplest exercise</B> for this tool is copying words, for instance: 
<BR> 
<a href="/phrases/?wpm=12&category=Word&filename=`3-letter3"> 3 letter words </a>
<BR>
When using the tool on a PC, "hot keys" are provided to control the exercise:
<BR> - Right Arrow: Get the next phrase
<BR> - Left Arrow: Play the phrase again
<BR> - Up Arrow: Reveal the phrase
<BR> - Down Arrow: Hide the next phrase
<BR>
    On all devices, these functions may be accessed with a click or touch. 
</p><p>
    One of the <b>most difficult</b> exercises for this practice tool would be:
     <BR><a href="/phrases/?wpm=20&category=Rhyming+Couplet&filename=Shakespeare"> Shakespearean Rhyming Couplets </a><BR>
    Thousands of phrases are available with varying difficulty.    
</p><P>
    Students may practice at slow speeds by writing out the copy.  To prepare for higher level skills, students should try to do these exercises as head copy.   
</P>
</p><P>
    <i><b> For effective learning and progress, students should set the difficulty level so that some misses occur, but where much is recognized.   Someplace in that zone will be the sweet spot for progress.</b></i>  
</P>
